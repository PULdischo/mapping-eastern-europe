    "text":"<p><em>By Alice Isabella Sullivan | University of Michigan</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nBetween 1512 and 1521, Prince Neagoe Basarab was the ruler of Wallachia&mdash;the Romanian principality extending to the south of the Carpathian Mountains and north of the Danube River in modern Romania. In 1505, Neagoe married Milica Despina of Serbia&mdash;a descendant of the houses of Brankovi\u0107 and Lazarevi\u0107&mdash;and together they had six children. There are few extant images of Neagoe Basarab and his family. A less known composition of the group is preserved on the inside lid of a wooden box now in the collection of Saint Catherine Monastery on Mount Sinai. The indentations of where the hardware once attached the lid to the box remain visible on the object, so clearly the image in the central composition once decorated the inside of the lid of a wooden chest.<br />\r\nThe painting shows eight kneeling figures in prayer directing their attention toward the central upper portion of the composition where an image of the Virgin Mary with the Christ Child in a heavenly sphere fixates their attention and that of the viewer. The image of the Virgin and Christ is that of the Blachernitissa type with roots in the icon from the Church of the Blachernai in Constantinople (now Istanbul). It generally shows the Virgin half-length and with both her hands raised to either side&mdash;in an orans gesture&mdash;and with the Christ Child upon her bosom. Christ directs his blessing toward the faithful, and the Virgin, in turn, intercedes on their behalf. In the lower portion of the Sinai panel, the eight kneeling figures are divided into two groups: the men on the left and the women on the right. The distinct features and garments of the figures, as well as the inscriptions in Church Slavonic above their heads, helps identify them. On the left, the image displays Neagoe Basarab (d. 1521) and his three sons: Theodosius, Peter, and John. On the right is his wife, Milica Despina (d. 1554), and their daughters: Stana, Ruxandra, and Angelina. The panel preserves a unique image of this royal family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe image on the Sinai lid resembles closely the votive mural of Neagoe and his family painted on the interior of the Church of the Dormition of the Virgin at Curtea de Arge\u0219 Monastery in Romania. The image shows all eight members of the Basarab family standing and offering a model of the very church in which they are depicted to an image of the Virgin and Child in the heavens above similar to the one found on the Sinai panel. The features and garments of the figures in both family portraits resemble each other, suggesting that the painting on the Sinai lid is contemporaneous with the votive image at Curtea de Arge\u0219.<br />\r\nDuring his reign, Prince Neagoe Basarab was concerned with the proper education of his heirs. Therefore, he penned the little-known but important text titled <em>The Teachings of Neagoe Basarab to His Son Theodosius</em>. This is an unparalleled <em>speculum principum </em>written in Church Slavonic in the Eastern Orthodox cultural sphere, contemporaneous with, yet divergent in its ideologies from, Machiavelli&rsquo;s political treatise <em>The Prince</em> (<em>De Principatibus</em>, 1513; published 1532). As the oldest among the sons, Theodosius succeeded his father to the throne on September 15, 1521. Due to his young age at the time, his mother, Milica, acted as his regent. Unfortunately, Theodosius died only a few months after taking the crown, in January 1522. Little is known of Neagoe and Milica&rsquo;s other two sons, Peter and John. As for the daughters, it is known that Stana married Moldavia&rsquo;s prince Stephen IV (r. 1517&ndash;1527), and Ruxandra married Radu of Afuma\u021bi, who took control of Wallachia after Theodosius&rsquo;s death (r. 1522&ndash;1529).<br />\r\nAs a ruler of an Orthodox land in the decades after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Neagoe Basarab fostered relations with the monastic communities on Mount Athos&mdash;the pan-Orthodox community of Christians that served as an enduring emblem of Eastern Christianity. It is known that Neagoe made monetary donations and gifted precious icons, manuscripts, embroideries, and metalwork to the Athonite monasteries. His efforts renew for those communities the objects needed for the celebration of the liturgy and ensured his remembrance among the local monks. His deeds aligned with the long tradition of patronage of Athos among the rulers of the north-Danubian principalities&mdash;a tradition that began during the second half of the fourteenth century and intensified after the fall of the Byzantine Empire. This is especially evident in the Athonite patronage of Moldavia&rsquo;s ruler Prince Stephen III (r. 1457&ndash;1504), for example.<br />\r\nIt would not be out of the question that Prince Neagoe Basarab also extended gifts to the Monastery of Saint Catherine on Mount Sinai&mdash;a topic worthy of further scholarly investigation. Upon its arrival at Sinai, those who opened the wooden chest would have first encountered the image of the Wallachian prince alongside his immediate family, shown in a gesture of prayer and supplication to the Virgin and Christ. The image displays the faith of the patron, and his hope for eventual salvation for himself, his wife, and their children. But the image was also intended to incite prayer and remembrance for the patron and his family among the monastic community at Sinai receiving his gifts. The box to which the lid in question once belonged could have carried precious icons, manuscripts, and embroideries from Wallachia to Sinai. Some may still be preserved today in the collection of the monastery and in the Sinai digital archives at the University of Michigan and Princeton University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nCernea, Emanuela, and Lucre\u021bia P\u0103tr\u0103\u0219canu.<em> M\u0103rturii: Frescele M\u0103n\u0103stirii Arge\u0219ului.

    "text":"<p><em>By&nbsp;Christian Raffensperger&nbsp;</em>|&nbsp;<em>Wittenberg University</em><br />\r\n<strong>Historical Overview</strong><br />\r\nThe kingdom of Rus was the largest kingdom in medieval Europe by territory. It stretched from the Gulf of Finland in the north, where cities such as Ladoga and then Novgorod provided bases for trade and power; to Polotsk on the Dvina, which provided another route from the Baltic to the interior of eastern Europe; the territory&rsquo;s capital was at Kyiv on the Dnieper, which was centrally located on the north-south Dnieper trade route, as well as the east-west land trade route. Its power extended to the southwest into the newly forming areas of Galicia and Volhynia, stretching across the headwaters of the Pripyat, Vistula, Dniester, and Bug Rivers. The region not only had natural salt deposits, but easy access to a variety of other areas, though with no natural borders, it was prone to conquest, as would be seen in its history. Rus also stretched to the northeast, especially the areas between the Volga and Oka rivers, which would eventually form the heartland for Muscovy, a potential successor state. This area was well known for fur gathering, but especially for fur transshipment down the Volga to the world of Central Asia. Its distance from the rest of Europe did not preclude contact with western and central Europe, but it did make it more difficult (and less common) than for areas located closer, such as Kyiv, Novgorod, or Galicia-Volhynia.<br />\r\nThe political unity of the kingdom of Rus fractured over the course of the 12th century, which left it in multiple kingdoms, often called principalities, in the 13th century. The different kingdoms centered in places as diverse as Novgorod in the north, Vladimir-Suzdal in the northeast, Smolensk on the Dnieper, and Galicia-Volhynia in the southwest. Each had their own policies, chronicles, ecclesiastical authorities, and so forth.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe arrival of the Mongols in the middle of the 13th century dramatically changed the entirety of Rus for the rest of its history. The Mongols overran, sacked, and subsequently controlled the majority of Rus, excepting only Novgorod in the north beginning ca. 1236&ndash;41, most likely due to the surrender of the city under Alexander Nevsky (r. Novgorod 1236&ndash;59 [with interregna]). Though the Mongols continued west to sack Poland and Hungary as well, the death of Khan Ogedei (d. 1241) resulted in the establishment of a rough border of Mongol control on the eastern perimeter or Rus, with the Galician-Volhynian territories of modern left-bank Ukraine, passing in and out of Mongol, Hungarian, Polish, and later Lithuanian control.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe traditional story of the rise of Russia follows the translation of power from Kyiv, the center of the kingdom of Rus, to Vladimir-Suzdal in the northeast during the 12th and 13th centuries, and then to Moscow in the 14th century. Moscow&rsquo;s first well-known ruler was Daniil (d. 1303), son of Alexander Nevsky. Daniil began the struggle for regional dominance with Moscow&rsquo;s rival &ndash; Tver. His signal success was keeping Moscow independent, gathering additional territory, and passing it all intact to his son Iurii (r. Moscow 1303&ndash;25). Iurii is the first of the rulers of Moscow to convince the Mongol khan, Uzbeg (d. 1341) in this instance, to give him the<em> iarlyk</em>, a patent to rule and collect taxes, as well as what named him Grand Prince of Vladimir. The wealth generated by this fueled Moscow&rsquo;s rise, and their continuing conflict with Tver, and their wealth generation came to a head with Iurii&rsquo;s son Ivan (r. Moscow 1325&ndash;41), nicknamed Kalita or moneybags. The wealth gathered by Ivan Kalita put Moscow on an unalterable path to victory over its regional rivals, though there would be, of course, bumps in the road ahead. The path of Muscovy though was largely one of alignment with the Mongol world, which took it farther from connections with the rest of Europe, leading to the eventual arrival of British explorers in the 16th century in Muscovy who felt that they were &ldquo;discovering&rdquo; new territory.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThis is not the only story of Rus, however, as has been alluded to thus far. The Dnieper region as well as the territory of Galicia-Volhynia began to go their own ways during the period following the arrival of the Mongols in the mid-13th century, if not before. Galycia-Volhynia in particular presents an interesting example as it maintained robust negotiations with the Mongols to their east, the Hungarians to their southwest, the Poles to their north and northwest, as well as with distant powers such as the Lithuanians farther north. These interactions led, following the extinction of the Volodimerovichi / Riurikid ruling line, to claimants for power from both Hungary and Poland, and the eventual incorporation of this territory into both kingdoms at different times in the 14th century. The rise of Lithuania and the unification of Poland and Lithuania in the late 14th century, and especially closer cooperation in the 15th century led to their expansion down the Dnieper and the absorption of much of the Dnieper and Galician-Volhynian territory into Poland-Lithuania during the 15th century. This is where it would stay for the remainder of the period under discussion, though Muscovy would expand closer and closer to the Dnieper in the 16th century.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe sources available for the study of Rus in this period are both many and few, as odd as that may seem. The source base is largely dependent upon which location one chooses to study and what languages one wishes to study. The focus on Muscovy and the northeast of Rus is typically conducted in Russian, and Old East Slavic. There exist multiple chronicle accounts that start with the <em>Povest&rsquo; vremennykh let</em> (tale of bygone years) as the base, and extend from its conclusion in the early 11th century with regional chronicles. The Laurentian is the most well-known of these, though there are multiple others for the northeast. By the 14th and 15th centuries, there is a marked increase in record keeping and we see copies of religious texts abound, including the <em>Komchaia kniga </em>(Pilot Book), charters of all kinds (religious and secular), as well as other documents. If one chooses to study the southwest, the basic chronicles, such as the Galician-Volhynian chronicle, are in Old East Slavic, but one also has recourse to information about this part of Rus in multiple Latin sources, from Poland, Hungary, and Lithuania &ndash; all of which dealt with and even controlled this area at one time or another. Additionally, this area had increased interaction with Byzantium, and so we see its mention more frequently in Byzantine and Balkan sources as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nOne of the most interesting and long-lasting debates about this region in the period under discussion is how to classify or categorize Rus in relation to regions and other polities. In the 1970s, Dimitri Obolensky codified the idea of the Byzantine Commonwealth in which Byzantium (the medieval Roman Empire) ruled over a nebulous polity extending beyond its conventional political borders and was inclusive of areas that were &ldquo;Orthodox&rdquo; and shared Byzantine culture. This idea went largely unchallenged until the 21st century when Anthony Kaldellis (<em>Hellenism in Byzantium: The Transformations of Greek Identity and the Reception of the Classical Tradition</em>, 2007), and Christian Raffensperger pointed out multiple problems, including that there were multiple religious connections between the &ldquo;Orthodox&rdquo; and &ldquo;Latin&rdquo; worlds, indicative of the idea that people did not think in those terms in the High Middle Ages; as well as the fact that there is no positive evidence from Byzantium to demonstrate that the Byzantines ever thought about such a supra-national entity. Such critiques, of course, have not kept the idea from persisting, and even flourishing in scholarship.<br />\r\nAs noted, Obolensky&rsquo;s idea, while articulated in an innovative fashion, was merely the codification of a long-standing view of the place of Rus (the focus of this article) in relation to the rest of the medieval world. As far back as the end of the 19th century, N. M. Karamzin and Mykhailo Hrushevsky, reflecting respectively the traditional Russian, and nascent Ukrainian perspectives, debated over the place of Rus in regard to Europe. Karamzin&rsquo;s Rus was merely the foreground to Russia and so after the arrival of the Mongols in the 13th century, the centers of power shifted from the Dnieper region to the northeast and the Volga-Oka region, specifically to Moscow. Karamzin paid less attention to the Crimea and modern Ukraine until those territories were conquered by the Muscovite state much later in time. Hrushevsky instead focused on what he called &ldquo;Ukraine-Rus&rdquo; and on the Dnieper territory, as well as the areas watered by the Bug, Dniester, and other southern rivers. In his writing, Rus was part of the larger medieval European world &ndash; in some ways quite literally as parts of Rus were absorbed by Poland, Hungary, and almost all of historic Rus was eventually taken over by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by the 15th and 16th centuries.&nbsp;<br />\r\nDespite this discussion well over one-hundred years ago, very few people in the Anglophone world read Hrushevsky&rsquo;s work because it was only published in Ukrainian (barring volume 1), and so such conversations about the place of Rus continued and took many different avenues. One of the most common is the relations between Rus and the Mongols from the 13th century onward. Russian scholars historically dealt with this period by referring to it as the &ldquo;Tatar Yoke,&rdquo; a period in which the Russian people suffered under Mongol cruelty (referred to as Tatars in Russian literature). They suggested that little to nothing was learned from the Mongols and there was almost no contact between the two groups. American scholars Charles Halperin and Donald Ostrowski challenged this perspective in different ways in the late 20th century. Halperin articulated an idea that Russian sources consciously chose not to mention the Mongols and any influence they might have &ndash; the &ldquo;ideology of silence.&rdquo; Ostrowski took a different tack, and utilizing a plethora of non-Russian sources demonstrated the enormous connections and manifold appropriations by Muscovy from the Mongols. Though the two American scholars do not entirely agree, their work has advanced the scholarship in such a way that now very few assume that there was no influence or interaction.<br />\r\nOne of the most recent issues, following the end of the Cold War and the demise of the Soviet Union is how to fit Rus into Europe. While this is an issue that Karamzin and Hrushevsky debated a century ago, it is being refought by a new generation of scholars in a much changed environment. Polish scholar Jerzy K\u0142oczowski has advanced the term &ldquo;Younger Europe&rdquo; to describe the areas that were not part of the Roman Empire, and were Christianized later. Though Rus, Christianized in 988/989, should fit into Younger Europe, it is often left out because of its relationship to Byzantium. Proponents of Central Europe as a term often define their work in clear ways to connect themselves to the West. A recent example is Nora Berend, Przemys\u0142aw Urba\u0144czyk, and Przemys\u0142aw Wiszewski&rsquo;s <em>Central Europe in the High Middle Ages </em>(2013). This excellent work begins with an overview chapter that defines the focus area of Bohemia, Poland, and Hungary as Central Europe not (explicitly) Eastern Europe. This leaves Rus in the unwanted category of Eastern Europe. The same is true of the proponents of another geographic term &ndash; East-Central Europe, which also covers Bohemia, Poland, and Hungary, though can also cover the Balkans; but again, not Rus. The legacy of the 20th century is that &ldquo;Eastern Europe&rdquo; is bad and no one wants to be identified with that. Rus pays the price for that legacy and is thus difficult to associate with other geographic groupings.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThere is a very recent movement in Anglophone scholarship though to attempt to connect Rus into the larger medieval world. Christian Raffensperger began this for the High Middle Ages with his <em>Reimagining Europe: Kievan Rus in the Medieval World,</em> and it has been continued and expanded upon by the work of Yulia Mikhailova and Natalia Zajac. For later periods, there is less work focusing on the inclusive interactions between Rus and the rest of medieval Europe, but there are signs that this is changing. In just the last year, books have been published by Vitaliy Mykhaylovskiy and M&aacute;rta Font and G&aacute;bor Barab&aacute;s covering such interactions in the 13th to 15th centuries. There is hope then that this trend will continue and Rus can be fully integrated into a larger European world in the scholarship.<br />\r\nThe modern implications of this scholarly debate are self-explanatory. If Rus can be part of medieval and early modern Europe, perhaps then Ukraine at least, and Russia possibly, can be part of modern Europe. This argument has been made explicit even in regard to Ukraine&rsquo;s possible association with the European Union. History can be used by modern states, but also by modern historians &ndash; and perhaps we can use it to build bridges not just walls.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nHrushevsky, Mykhailo. <em>History of Ukraine-Rus&rsquo;.</em>&nbsp;Vol. 3, <em>To the Year 1340.</em>&nbsp;Translated by&nbsp;Bohdan Strumi\u0144ski, ed.

The new cultures of learning that emerged among the literate elite sought to reshape knowledge about the past and employed a series of South Slavonic, Byzantine, Italianate, and other sources to imagine new genealogies of power and legitimate expansion by depicting Muscovy/Russia as the heir to great empires of the past. This project is expected to form the second part of my anticipated book: <em>Politics and Ritual in Rus and Muscovy</em> that examines political practices, the externalization of princely power through ceremony and ritual, and material conditions that produced princely authority, from the time of early Rus&#39; to Muscovy, ending with the period that saw the rise of the Tsardom of Russia.<br />\r\n<strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nVukovich, Alexandra. &quot;How Byzantine was the Moscow Inauguration of 1498?&rdquo; In <em>Byzantium in Eastern European Culture in the Late Middle Ages</em>, edited by Maria Alessia Rossi and Alice Isabella&nbsp;Sullivan,&nbsp;35<span style=\"font-size:11.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">&ndash;</span></span></span>71.&nbsp;Leiden: Brill, 2020.</p>",

This book conceives it as performative narrative discourse, as stories that made active social subjects and the space they lived in. It examines the period of the half-century after the Crusaders&rsquo; conquest and colonization of Byzantine territories. It reconciles modern theoretical considerations and the interpretation of medieval texts. The author reads the narratives from Nicaea, Epiros, and Serbia in texts ranging from imperial orations and hagiographies, to monastic donations and juridical opinions, not as representations of events, but as active social practices that created the world. Using the notions of how individuals become subjects and produce space, the study proposes ways in which specific emperors, bishops, monks, and peasants interacted as storytellers, heroes, and social agents. It argues for diversified social and political agencies and marginalizes standard narratives of Byzantine fragmentation and Serbian independence.<br />\r\n<strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nVuka&scaron;inovi\u0107, Milan. &ldquo;Doing and Telling Administration and Diplomacy: Speech Acts in the 13th-Century Balkans.&rdquo; In <em>Trends and Turning Points: Constructing the Late Antique and Byzantine World</em>, edited by Matthew&nbsp;Kinloch and Alex&nbsp;MacFarlane, 83&ndash;97.

    "text":"<p><i>By Alice Isabella Sullivan </i>| <i>University of Michigan</i><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe treasury at Putna Monastery in Romania preserves a wooden sacristy chest, measuring 23-2/5 x 80-7/10 x 24-1/4 in (59.5 X 205 X 61.5 cm), with a central decorative scheme on its front panel that displays a crowded scene of the <em>Crucifixion</em> centred on the body of Christ on the central cross and those of the two thieves to either side of him. In the image, the Virgin Mary mourns her son&rsquo;s death, Mary Magdalen hugs the foot of Christ&rsquo;s cross, which rises over the &ldquo;place of the skull&rdquo; (Adam&rsquo;s burial), while a multitude of figures look in amazement at the events unfolding before their eyes. Lancets and flags pierce the starry sky and angels descend onto the scene.<br />\r\nSix vignettes showing moment from the Passion of Christ surround the central <em>Crucifixion</em> image on the Putna chest. Furthermore, a decorative border frames on three sides the central image and its adjacent scenes. Here, undulating vegetal forms encircle human and angelic figures, as well as real and fantastical creatures, such as lions and griffins, in addition to several coat of arms. The latter would have once displayed painted motifs that would have helped identify the patron of the object. Moreover, the scenes are carved in low relief, stamped, and punched onto cypress wood, with elements drawn in ink, using a technique called <em>pyrografata</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nThe wooden sacristy chest from Putna was likely produced during the 15th century. The idiosyncratic iconography of this object&nbsp;has roots in Italian and Cretan images of the second half of the 14th century. The crowded and complex scenes of the <em>Crucifixion</em> on the Putna chest derives from earlier visual sources, including the rich iconography of such image types that developed at the crossroads of Byzantium and the West. For instance, on the left of the composition, the church with a distinct rose window and open gallery below, as well as a belfry in the back, recalls similar buildings incorporated into <em>Crucifixion</em> scenes on Cretan icons. In addition, a now-lost wall fresco in San Felice Chapel in the Basilica of San Antonio in Padua, executed by Altichiero (active ca. 1369&ndash;ca. 1384), offers an intriguing precedent for the development of this image type that circulated in both the Italian and Cretan cultural contexts from at least the second half of the 14th century onward.<br />\r\nThe execution and layout of the composition of the Putna chest also resemble altar frontals, or <em>antependia</em>. Examples from Castille&mdash;such as the Geri Lapi&rsquo;s <em>Crucifixion </em>from the Collegiate Church of Santa Maria, Manresa (Catalonia)&mdash;display a central scene, usually showing Christ in a mandorla or an image of the <em>Crucifixion</em> with marginal scenes from Christ&rsquo;s life to either side. Such examples reinforce the hypothesis that embroiderers and woodcarvers, as well as icon painters, worked from similar models in creating their compositions.<br />\r\nWooden chests decorated in the<em> pyrografata</em> technique&mdash;using a hot needle to incise the design and accentuate select details using verdigris and vermillion pigments&mdash;were produced in Italian workshops and exported throughout Europe during the pre-modern period, including the regions of the Balkan Peninsula and the Carpathian Mountains. They were used in both secular and ecclesiastical contexts. Their materiality, technique, and iconography reveal aspects of their origins and functions. Examples decorated in the same technique and displaying similar compositional schemes as those found on the Putna chest survive in European and North American collections, such as the <em>Fountain of Love Cassone</em> from ca. 1460 now in the Kunstgewerbemuseum, Berlin, and the wooden panel displaying the Crucifixion, now in the collection of the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art (Met; 1980.519). Given the materials, technique of production, and iconography of the main panel of the Putna chest, it is possible that it hails from a north Italian workshop. The Christological imagery suggests the spiritual dimension of the commission, but also that perhaps the chest may have been used to hold religious objects, such as textiles, icons, and manuscripts.<br />\r\nThe wooden chest typically functioned as a household piece of furniture, but it could have been equally well suited for an ecclesiastical context, especially if its imagery was drawn from Christological, Mariological, or hagiographical subjects. In the case of the wooden sacristy chest from Putna, several arguments have been put forth. One suggestion is that the chest was used to hold the relics of one of Moldavia&rsquo;s patron saint, St. John the New (d. ca. 1330); another explanation refers to the chest&rsquo;s Italian origin and proposes that it likely arrived in Moldavia filled with rich textiles as a courtly gift; yet another hypothesis puts forth the idea that the chest was used to transport religious textiles, icons, and manuscripts, and possibly arrived in Moldavia via Serbia and Wallachia in 1473 when Maria Despina and her daughter Maria Voichi\u021ba came to the Moldavian court. Given its prominent Christian imagery on the exterior in particular, the wooden sacristy chest from Putna was likely designed to store religious items or those with spiritual value for the patron, although its functions changed over time due to its new contexts of use and display.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nBacci, Michele. &ldquo;Mod&egrave;les italiens dans la peinture d&rsquo;ic&ocirc;nes au Moyen &Acirc;ge tardif: la Crucifixion cr&eacute;toise du Mus&eacute;e National de Stockholm.&rdquo; In <em>M&eacute;langes offerts &agrave; Fabienne Joubert: Faire et bien faire: Commande et cr&eacute;ation artistiques au Moyen &Acirc;ge</em>, edited by Denise Borl&eacute;e and Laurence Rivi&egrave;re Ciavaldini, 249&ndash;261.

    "text":"<p><em>By Alice Isabella Sullivan </em>| <em>University of Michigan</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nThe burial cover of Maria of Mangup, preserved in the collection of Putna Monastery in Romania, features a funerary portrait of the second wife of Prince Stephen III of Moldavia (r. 1457&ndash;1504). The cloth shows Maria Asanina Palaiologina (d. 1477) full length and in a recumbent pose, like a <em>gisant</em>, with her arms folded across her chest and her hands gently clasped. Her oval face with its small mouth, long thin nose, and arched eyebrows offer a glimpse of her countenance. Her hair, parted down the middle, is mostly concealed by her elaborate headdress, the Byzantine <em>propoloma</em>. In this case, her Byzantine-inspired regalia is finely worked with precious stones and pearl hangings. Jewels also adorn Maria&rsquo;s ears, neck, and fingers. A blue\u2011green <em>granatza</em> of a Perso\u2011Assyrian origin&ndash;a sumptuously brocaded dress and caftan-like mantle with red lining and long sleeves reaching to the ankles&ndash;completes Maria&rsquo;s regal attire.<br />\r\nAs the only embroidered tomb cover in the Putna collection, alongside others made of brocade, the burial cover of Maria of Mangup was executed in colored silks embroidered with polychrome silks and gold threads, with the now mainly damaged background consisting of couched gold threads arranged vertically. Stephen&nbsp;III likely commissioned the grave cover for his wife&rsquo;s tomb located in the burial chamber (now naos) of the Church of the Dormition of the Virgin at Putna Monastery, opposite his burial site, and under a baldachin similarly elaborate to his.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe burial cover of Maria of Mangup engages with a long tradition of medieval aristocratic funerary portraits in western Europe. Incised in stone or carved in various degrees of relief, these grave markers show the deceased in a frontal and full-length pose, often richly dressed, and framed within an architectural structure reminiscent of a church or baldachin. A dedicatory inscription running around the perimeter of the slab and/or a coat of arms identifies in part the individual(s) represented. The tomb cover of Maria of Mangup, however, is also deeply indebted to Byzantine models and reflects the exceptional workmanship of Moldavian embroideries during the second half of the 15th century.<br />\r\nThe burial cover of Maria of Mangup displays a varied and sophisticated technique with roots in Byzantine embroidery traditions. Gold thread once covered the entirety of the red silk background, but unfortunately now survives only in select areas. Gold and silver wire with colored silks in various configurations and stiches provide the variety of detail in Maria&rsquo;s appearance and the structure of her surroundings. Although relatively smooth, certain features of the composition are slightly raised with padding threads underneath, as is evident in the outline of her headdress and various jewels, as well as in the framing arch and its decorations. The designers and those who executed this burial cover spared no expense and carefully crafted for posterity the image of this Byzantine princess on the Moldavian throne.<br />\r\nMaria is reposing underneath a cusped trefoil arch that delineates her figure and balances the composition. The presence of the arcature is also suggestive of her royal status. It is decorated with the monogram of the Palaiologan Dynasty, and a repertoire of decorative and vegetal motifs found on other contemporary embroideries executed in the Putna workshop. In place of a decorative border around the perimeter, Maria&rsquo;s grave cover displays a dedicatory inscription in Church Slavonic that reads: &ldquo;This is the tomb cover of the servant of God, the pious and devout to Christ, wife of John Stephen voivode, prince of the land of Moldavia, Maria, who passed to the eternal dwelling in the year 6985 [1477], the month of December 19, at five o&rsquo;clock during the day.&rdquo; Although formulaic, the inscription is unusual in that it is interrupted in the corners by four emblems: in the upper left and lower right are the double-headed eagles, the imperial symbols of Byzantium; the lower left corner shows the famous and wide-spread monogram of the Palaiologan Dynasty, which appears again in a correct and a reverse position in the decorations of the trefoil arch in the central register of the embroidery (in the correct orientation on the left roundel and in a reverse position in the right roundel); and the upper right corner shows the initials for Maria&rsquo;s other family name, Asanina. Symbolically weighty, these important dynastic emblems represent the earliest known identifiers of this kind on any extant embroidered work in Moldavia.<br />\r\nA veil of mystery still shrouds the actual display and function of Maria&rsquo;s burial cover. Textiles such as this were certainly designed for particular tombs because their measurements often correlate with the dimensions of their respective gravestones. This is true of the cover for the burial of Maria of Mangup. It is possible that they were placed on top of the tombs during particular celebrations or on special feast days. What is peculiar, however, is the direction of the text of the surrounding dedicatory inscription on Maria&rsquo;s grave cover.

    "text":"<p><em>By Valentina \u017divkovi\u0107 | Institute for Balkan Studies, Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nSt. Tryphon, the 3rd-century young martyr from Phrygian Campsada, is the patron saint of Kotor (modern day Montenegro). The cult of St. Tryphon appeared in Kotor around 809, when Andrea Saracenis, a citizen from Kotor, bought his relics and built the first church in honor of the saint. The relic of the head of the saint is kept in the &ldquo;Glorious Head&rsquo;&rsquo; reliquary made in stages between the 13th and 17th centuries. A bone from the body of St. Tryphon is kept in the reliquary made in the shape of a casket with a slightly concave roof. Executed in wood and covered in silver, the reliquary was completed sometime between 1539 and 1551. Both reliquaries are kept in the St. Tryphon Cathedral Treasury and displayed on the altar of the Cathedral and in the procession through the streets of Kotor during St. Tryphon&rsquo;s Day, each year on February 3.&nbsp;<br />\r\nSt. Tryphon&rsquo;s Reliquary Casket is probably the work of local goldsmiths, who executed numerous reliquaries predominantly in the shape of arms and legs during the late medieval and early modern periods. The silver sheet that covers the chest displays the reliefs of six scenes of the torture and death of St. Tryphon. On the large front sides there are two narrative scenes on rectangular panels, and only one on the narrower, lateral sides. There is a sequence of the following narrative scenes separated by pilasters: St. Tryphon drawn and quartered by horses, St. Tryphon&rsquo;s flagellation, St. Tryphon tied to a column, the torture of St. Tryphon by fire, the stoning of St. Tryphon, and the death (by beheading) of St. Tryphon. The figure of St. Tryphon with the palm branch and model of the town of Kotor in his hands is represented twice on the longer sides of the casket roof. The patron saint of the town of Kotor is shown frontally, dressed in a toga and a cloak, flanked by two dragons and cherubims. &nbsp;The triangular fields that flank the two panels with the representation of St. Tryphon show medallions with symbols of the Evangelists in palm branches. Pelicans surrounded by zoomorphic and vegetable motifs of dolphins and acanthus leaves can be found on the narrow sides of the casket. All the narrative scenes from the martyrdom cycles of the St. Tryphon are typified by a combining of traditional hieratic late medieval style with the perspectival approach of the early Renaissance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThere are no primary sources related to the origin of Kotor&rsquo;s reliquary casket. The specific iconography can reveal aspects about the historical and religious context in which it was created. St. Tryphon on the casket roof is shown holding a model of a town with a flag of the Lion of St. Mark, and so it is possible to propose a date after 1420 when Kotor became part of the Venetian Republic (until 1797). The year 1551 was proposed as the <em>terminus ante quem</em>, considering that the reliquary is mentioned in the poem <em>Descriptio sinus et urbis Ascriviensis </em>by the poet Giovanni Bona de Boliris, which dates between 1539 and 1551. Kotor cathedral was represented with a dome that existed until the 1563 earthquake when it collapsed and was never rebuilt. The representation of the ramparts with curved towers on the south and north sides that reflect the actual fortifications of Kotor offer the possibility of a more precise dating of the reliquary casket after the Venetian victory (under the command of the <em>provveditore</em> Gian Matteo Bembo) over the <em>kapudan pacha </em>Hayreddin Barbarossa (1475&ndash;1546) during the Ottoman siege of Kotor in 1539.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe iconography of the narrative scenes of the torture and death of St. Tryphon additionally gives credence to the presumption on the dating of the reliquary casket in the years immediately following Barbarossa&rsquo;s attack of Kotor. Namely, the Turks as contemporary enemies and participants of historical events are interpolated as the torturers of St. Tryphon. The torturers are represented as bearded and turbaned Turks with sabres around their waists. In the final scene of the death of the young martyr, the executioner, dressed in military attire, is showing the severed head of St. Tryphon to the prefect Aquilinus seated upon a throne. With some caution (which is necessary when identifying the portrait features of the participants in a hagiographic narrative scene), I would like to point out the manner in which the prefect is represented. He is depicted as a resolute man wearing a turban, with a thick beard and long whiskers, a strong and slightly hooked nose, and with bushy eyebrows joined together in a frown. Similarities of the features of the prefect Aquilinus on the Kotor reliquary casket can be observed by comparing them to the portraits of Hayreddin Barbarossa, such as that found in the 1535 engraving by Agostino dei Musi (called Veneziano).&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe narrative of the holy patron saint of the town receiving a celestial award for his suffering represents a victory of Christian Kotor and it had occurred under the spiritual and political power of the Venetian flag of Saint Mark. In the same context of emphasizing Venetian merit, the choice of the form of the reliquary can also be considered. It was made to resemble, at least for the basic form of the reliquary with narrative scenes, the Tomb-Shrine of St. Simeon displayed in the church of St. Simeon in Zadar and commissioned by Queen Elizabeth Kotromani\u0107 (ca.1339&ndash;87)&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe hagiographical works undoubtedly served as a literary template for the iconography of the scenes of the torture and death of St. Tryphon on the reliquary casket. The partially preserved 12th century hagiography <em>Suffering of Saint Tryphon and Saint Blaise</em> (Library of the Archaeological Museum in Split) renders the description of the torture of St. Tryphon by fire, horses, flagellation, stoning, and finally beheading - scenes that were also presented on the 16th century reliquary casket. Particular attention should be paid to the iconographic representation of death, that is, when St. Tryphon <em>recepit gladium, et consumauit martirium</em>. The 12th century hagiography testifies that St. Tryphon uttered the following before he died: <em>Ihesu Xpiste, domine, suscipe spiritum meum.</em> That moment is represented on the reliquary casket in the form of an angel who takes the soul of St. Tryphon to heaven. Another hagiographic text was written at the time of the reliquary casket - <em>Offitium Sancti Triphonis Martyris, Civitatis Catharensis Patroni, omnia eius viatae miracula ac Martyrii certamina contiens </em>(printed in Venice in 1561), by Bishop Luca Bisanti who headed the Kotor bishopry from 1532 to 1565, and thus witnessed the Turkish siege in 1539.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nCapriotti, Giuseppe, and Borja Franco Llopis, eds. <em>Changing the Enemy, Visualizing the Other.

    "text":"<p><em>By&nbsp;Nicholas Melvani</em> | <em>Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe chapel known as the Bogdan Saray is a small Byzantine church with a crypt in Istanbul (former Constantinople). It is constructed of broad alternating bands of brick and stone, with each band consisting of four rows of stones or brick. This construction technique, which resembles the masonry of the Palaiologan additions to the Chora monastery, suggests a date in the 14th century. The lower part (the crypt) is an oblong hall terminating in an apse and is covered by a barrel vault. Its layout and the fact that three sarcophagi were found in it show that it had a funerary function. The upper story, which is also of the hall type, is vaulted and culminates in a circular bema, which is five-sided from the exterior.<br />\r\nRemains of adjacent walls indicate that it was originally an integral part (the northwestern section) of a large residential complex; a door on the south wall of the chapel seems to have connected the small church to the rest of the complex. The building follows an unusual orientation, to the northeast, due to its position within the residence. The&nbsp;simple plan and condensed size of the chapel are also consistent with this function. According to the sources, the chapel was dedicated to St. Nicholas. Although the Byzantine identity of the adjoining residence is unknown, it has been suggested that it was the private property of the Raoul/Ralles family, one of the most prominent Byzantine families before 1453, which was later purchased by descendants of the Byzantine imperial family of the Kantakouzenoi and subsequently by the rulers of the principality of Moldavia, to whom the site owes its name Bogdan Saray (Moldavian Palace). The building was badly damaged by fire in the 18th century, and today lies in ruins within a car repair store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe symbolic importance of the monument within the history and topography of Ottoman Istanbul can be understood on the basis of its archaeological remains and relevant textual sources. The Bogdan Saray church is a rare example of what appears to have been a chapel within an aristocratic mansion of the Late Byzantine period. No other such example is known from pre-1453 Constantinople, but judging from the information in textual sources about the nature of Byzantine aristocratic houses, it is possible that such chapels were common in residential complexes of wealthy families in the Byzantine capital. Of even greater significance is the continuous use of the chapel (and apparently of the entire compound) after the fall of Constantinople and its reuse by the Moldavians.<br />\r\nIn fact, the proximity to the seat of the Patriarchate, which in the latter half of the 15th century and most of the 16th century was based in the Byzantine monastery of the Virgin Pammakaristos, ca. 300 meters to the east, was an important factor in the installation of the Moldavians in this area, in relation to the Danubian principality&rsquo;s ideological claims to the legacy of Byzantium, as it was embodied by the Patriarchate. Indeed, the links between the Moldavian and Wallachian princes and the patriarchs of Constantinople are well known, and the rulers of both principalities consistently offered their financial support to the Patriarchate and its building complex. Since the ecclesiastical and lay aristocracy (the so-called <em>archontes</em>) gravitated around the neighborhood of the Pammakaristos, interaction with these elements was part of the efforts of the Moldavians to integrate with the circles of the Orthodox elites. This support was part of the general policy of the Danubian principalities toward the Christian religious foundations of the Ottoman Empire, which included the monasteries of Mount Athos, the monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai, and the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.<br />\r\nMoreover, the Byzantine past of the Bogdan Saray was also important in this context: by occupying an extensive Byzantine site in the capital of the former Byzantine Empire, the Moldavians were probably aware of the implications the property of a former Byzantine family had for political and ideological purposes. The installation in a recognizably Byzantine building preserving the tangible memory of Byzantium must have reinforced Moldavian aspirations to the legacy of Byzantium within the post-1453 Orthodox context. The proximity to the site of the monastery of St. John of Petra, a few hundred meters to the west, which was traditionally the object of Serbian patronage, may have also been relevant in this regard, as part of Moldavian and Wallachian policy of claiming the Byzantine heritage through connection with Serbia.<br />\r\nWhen Prince Peter the Lame of Moldavia (r. 1574&ndash;77, 1578&ndash;79) donated the Bogdan Saray to the Patriarchate in 1580, he stipulated that the building would function as his family&rsquo;s residence, whenever they visited Istanbul. Over the next few decades, the building&rsquo;s importance for the area remained strong within the framework of the topography of the Orthodox community of the Ottoman capital, even though the seat of the Patriarchate was transferred to its present location in the neighborhood of Fener, closer to the shore of the Golden Horn. During the 17th century, the Bogdan Saray hosted envoys from Moldavia to the Ottoman court and was occasionally leased to diplomatic missions from other countries, such as the Swedish ambassadors in Istanbul.<br />\r\nA similar case seems to be the so-called Eflak or Vlach Saray, which was the residence of the Wallachian representatives and followed an analogous historical course. Although the identity of its Byzantine predecessor is unclear, it appears that it was likewise a mansion once belonging to a wealthy Byzantine family, which remained in Christian hands after the transition to the Ottoman period. Like the Bogdan Saray, it also included a chapel attached to the residence. Thanks to the proximity to the Bogdan Saray and to the fact that both buildings are located in the wider area of the Patriarchate (both the Pammakaristos &ndash; its seat until the end of the 16th century &ndash; and St. George &ndash; the headquarters from the 17th century onwards) the two complexes formed a Romanian hub in the heart of the Christian community of Istanbul, the heir to Byzantine Constantinople.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nCazacu, Matei. &ldquo;Strat&eacute;gies matrimoniales et politiques des Cantacuz&egrave;ne sous la Turcocratie (XVe-XVIe s.).&rdquo; <em>Revue des Etudes Roumaines</em> 19-20 (1995-96): 157&ndash;181.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">Explains how the residential complex passed from the Byzantine family of Ralles to the Moldavian nobility.</p><p>Dark, Ken, and Ferudun &Ouml;zg&uuml;m&uuml;\u015f. <em>Constantinople: Archaeology of a Byzantine Megapolis.

    "text":"<p><em>By&nbsp;Drago\u0219 Gh. N\u0103st\u0103soiu </em>| <em>Centre for Medieval Studies, National Research University &ldquo;Higher School of Economics,&rdquo; Moscow</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Church of St. Nicholas in Ribi\u021ba is currently located in Hunedoara County (Romania), which belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary (Zar&aacute;nd County) during the Middle Ages. It was most likely built during the second half of the 14th century, according to a typology often encountered in the region&rsquo;s religious architecture derived from both Orthodox and Catholic models. The rectangular, vaulted sanctuary is separated from the nave by a built iconostasis, whereas the single-nave structure is dominated by a tall tower at the west end. Only a few stone carvings displaying unpretentious Gothic forms attest today to the medieval origin of the monument, which houses inside a rich and valuable ensemble of Byzantine frescoes.<br />\r\nThese wall paintings were affected by major architectural changes to the church in 1869&ndash;70 (partially removed in 1994&ndash;95, when the building was consolidated) and their restoration is not yet completed (the murals&rsquo; uncovering from under multiple paint layers was discontinuous: 1994, 1995&ndash;99, and 2009&ndash;11). Nevertheless, the church&rsquo;s late-medieval iconographic program can be reconstructed to a great extent. Holy bishops with scrolls and deacon-archangels with censers stand on both sides of the <em>Melismos</em> found in the eastern axis of the altar (the <em>Melismos</em> is the image of the sacrificed Christ on the altar or paten, symbolizing the Transubstantiation that occurs during the Liturgy). Writing Evangelists and seraphs make the transition from the register of holy bishops to the very fragmentary image of Christ in Glory on the vault. Scenes of Christ&rsquo;s Life and Passion decorate the upper register of the nave, whereas the Last Judgment consists of episodes randomly disposed in different areas inside the nave and the room below the western tower. The lower register of standing figures of saints contains also the votive composition (incompletely preserved), which shows the founders offering the model of the church to its patron, St. Nicholas. Belonging to the local noble family, these founders are brothers Vladislavu and Micl\u0103u\u015fu of Ribi\u021ba together with their wives (Stana and Sora, respectively) and little Ana, Vladislavu and Stana&rsquo;s daughter, who is represented below the model of the church. The dedicatory inscription in Church Slavonic is fragmentary (one of the missing elements is precisely the year in the dating) and various dates have been proposed for the execution of the Byzantine frescoes: 1404, 1407, 1414/15, or 1417. Additionally, a smaller dedicatory inscription (again fragmentary) on the northern wall of the sanctuary recorded the feast of the Ascension of Christ and another date, probably 15 May 1393. Another votive inscription is located on the image of St. John the Baptist on the southern wall of the nave and this implies that a certain Dobroslavu and his unnamed wife acted as minor donors for the church&rsquo;s murals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nAs it often happens in the region, the architecture of St. Nicholas Church in Ribi\u021ba has Western appearance, but its fresco decoration displays Byzantine features. This is a common trait of religious art commissioned by Orthodox Romanians in late-medieval Transylvania and, therefore, does not fit into the traditional East and West divide. Generally, the frescoes&rsquo; style and iconography can be safely labeled as &ldquo;Byzantine,&rdquo; but many Western elements can be identified in both the form and content of the mural decoration. This eclecticism is a general feature of 14th- and 15th-century religious art in the area and it is most likely a consequence of Transylvania&rsquo;s major role as a contact zone between the Slavic and Latin cultural spheres.<br />\r\nAlthough the church has a prevailing Western appearance conferred by its tall, western tower and Gothic stonework, this religious edifice actually served the Eastern Orthodox rite. Surprising as it may be, this feature is in fact a common trait of religious architecture commissioned during the 14th and 15th centuries by Orthodox Romanians, who resorted often to local builders active in the neighboring Catholic regions.<br />\r\nIn contrast with its outer appearance, the whole interior of the church was decorated with frescoes displaying a Byzantine morphology. Stylistically, they are similar with the murals of the neighboring church in Cri\u0219cior, commissioned probably in 1411 by another Romanian Orthodox noble family.<br />\r\nByzantine in essence, the iconographic program of the church displays features that are characteristic of programs ideated both on the periphery of Byzantium and in late-medieval Transylvania. Having been produced in a zone of contact between Eastern and Western cultural traditions, the religious painting of Orthodox Romanians was highly receptive to themes and motifs typical of Western/Catholic iconography. On the one hand, as it often happens in Byzantine churches without a dome or in churches built in the eastern periphery of Byzantium (e.g., Cappadocia or Georgia), the customary image of the Virgin with the Christ Child in the sanctuary&rsquo;s conch was replaced by that of Christ. However, the <em>Pantokrator</em> type occurs only in the mid-15th century frescoes in the sanctuary of Densu\u0219, whereas in the remaining cases (e.g., H\u0103lmagiu, Strei, Streis&acirc;ngeorgiu) the Western iconography of Christ in Glory (<em>Maiestas Domini</em>) was selected.<br />\r\nAs customarily in Byzantine sanctuaries, in the church in Ribi\u021ba holy bishops and deacons with scrolls, along with archangels with censers, stand to either side of the <em>Melismos</em>. Among these holy bishops, St. Nicholas of Myra, who is also the patron saint of the church, is ascribed a special place on the western side of the sanctuary&rsquo;s southern wall. He is depicted in the proximity of a chalice placed on an altar table covered by a ciborium, and the accompanying inscription mentions the heretic Arius, St. Nicholas&rsquo; opponent during the First Council of Nicea (325), who preached the anti-Homoousian heresy stating that God the Father was unique and the Son was subordinated to the Father. In the lower part of the altar table, the bent figure of Arius himself is depicted falling down. This image with Eucharistic and anti-heretical content &ndash; which uses the compositional scheme of the Vision of St. Peter of Alexandria, but substitutes the figure of the Alexandrian bishop with that of St. Nicholas &ndash; is an entirely original iconography encountered nowhere else but in the sanctuaries of Ribi\u021ba and H\u0103lmagiu, whose programs have been designed and painted around 1400.<br />\r\nFinally, in addition to holy warriors on horseback, pillar and martyr saints, and other saints that were widely venerated in the East (e.g., Sts. Helena, Nicholas, John the Baptist, Panteleimon, etc.), the register of standing figures in the nave contains also the Catholic Holy Kings of Hungary. Encountered in the neighboring Orthodox church in Cri\u0219cior, the three royal saints (i.e., Sts. Stephen, Emeric, and Ladislas) are in close iconographic relationship with the neighboring military saints on horseback and St. Helena in the scene of the Finding of the Holy Cross, as well as with the <em>ktetors&rsquo; </em>votive composition on the opposing, southern wall. This iconographic setting recalls the complex <em>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</em> of the founders&rsquo; and rulers&rsquo; portraits encountered in Byzantine, Balkan, and Carpathian monumental painting and reflects faithfully the political and social reality of the founders in Ribi\u021ba (and Cri\u0219cior). These were Romanian Orthodox noblemen living in the Catholic Kingdom of Hungary, and they sought the recognition of their legal rights by the kingdom&rsquo;s sources of power. Additionally, the phenomenon of shared devotion of Latin saints by Eastern-rite Christians occurs sometimes in those territories found under Latin rule (e.g., the representations of St. Francis of Assisi in the Orthodox churches of Venetian-ruled Crete) and they illustrate that medieval devotional practices transgressed at times the rigid confessional borders.<br />\r\nAnother interesting aspect of this church is that the votive composition and the church inscriptions in Church Slavonic shed light on the model of patronage practiced by Orthodox Romanians in the 14th and 15th centuries. In addition to the main <em>ktetors</em> depicted in the nave together with their families and offering the church to St. Nicholas, there are other fragmentary inscriptions implying that the church was decorated into two distinct phases and that other minor donors supported its decoration with murals. The shorter and fragmentary inscription uncovered in 1994 on the northern wall of the sanctuary recorded another important event for the church in Ribi\u021ba. Occurring on the feast of the Ascension of Christ, probably on 15 May 1393, this event was most likely the foundation of the church and the decoration of its sanctuary. The short prayer inscribed on St. John the Baptist&rsquo;s votive image on the southern wall of the nave names a certain Dobroslavu and his wife, implying that they, too, supported to a lesser extent the nave&rsquo;s decoration with murals. This model of religious foundation and artistic patronage is associative and cumulative in its nature, and presupposes the joint involvement of multiple donors, who contributed at different stages and to various degrees &ndash; each one according to his/her own financial ability &ndash; to the construction and decoration of a church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nAgrigoroaei, Vladimir. &ldquo;An <em>Interpretatio Wallachica</em> of Serbian Patterns: The Cases of Ribi\u021ba, Streis&acirc;ngeorgiu and Cri\u0219cior (but also R&acirc;me\u021b).&rdquo; <em>Acta Universitatis Apulensis.

    "text":"<p><em>By&nbsp;Marka Tomi\u0107 |&nbsp;The&nbsp;Institute&nbsp;for&nbsp;Byzantine Studies, Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Church of St. Demetrios in Su&scaron;ica near Skopje, present-day Republic of North Macedonia, was built between 1365/6 and 1371 by the Serbian king Vuka&scaron;in (Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107) (r. 1365&ndash;71). The fresco decoration was completed in 1376/7 under the patronage of his son, King Marko (r. 1371&ndash;95), hence its popular name &ldquo;Markov Manastir&rdquo;. The <em>katholikon</em> (main church) of Markov Manastir is one of the central monuments of Serbian history and art of the second half of the 14th century. It was built in the last great period of the Serbian medieval state, whose southwestern parts were ruled by two generations of the Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 family (r. 1365&ndash;95). Vuka&scaron;in&rsquo;s proclamation and coronation as the king of Serbs and Greeks and co-ruler of Emperor Uro&scaron; (r. 1355&ndash;71 ) marked the end of the two-century-long reign of the saint-bearing Nemanji\u0107 dynasty; the conferral of the title &lsquo;young king&rsquo; on his son Marko in late 1370 or early 1371 laid the foundation for the creation of a new dynasty.<br />\r\nThe builders and painters of Markov Manastir hailed from Skopje and Ohrid, the most important artistic centers in the Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 state. The Church of St. Demetrios is one of the finest representatives of the architectural developments in the territory of Povardarje in the late Middle Ages. The frescoes of Markov Manastir represent one of the most thematically elaborate, conceptually complex, and artistically important ensembles of Serbian wall painting of the second half of the 14th century. The iconographic programme comprises cycles (the Great Feasts, the Infancy of Christ, Christ&rsquo;s Public Ministry, the Menologion, the Passion of Christ, the Akathistos, the Life of St. Demetrios, the Life of St. Nicholas), a blend of traditional and completely original themes (The heavenly and earthly Great Entrances, Christ as the embodiment of the Wisdom of the Word of God, the images of the Dead Christ (&prime;&Alpha;&kappa;&rho;&alpha; &Tau;&alpha;&pi;&epsilon;\u1f77&nu;&omega;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;) and the Lamenting Virgin, the rulers&rsquo; <em>ktetorial</em> portraits, the Royal De&euml;sis and the Heavenly Court, the fresco decoration above the south entrance including <em>ktetorial</em> and royal portraits of Vuka&scaron;in and Marko Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 and the equestrian portrait of its patron saint, St. Demetrios above the west entrance to the church) and numerous individual images of saints.<br />\r\nThe Church of St. Demetrios still retains its original appearance; its frescoes are also remarkably well-preserved. They were fully uncovered during the conservation works carried out in 1968&ndash;70 beneath the more recent fresco layer from 1866. Frescoed in the 14th century, the old refectory also belongs to the earliest period, but its frescoes were heavily damaged in a fire and have consequently lost their original features and details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nThe date of construction and decoration of the Church of St. Demetrios at Markov Manastir is attested by the damaged <em>ktetorial</em> inscription above the south doorway of the naos. Recent research has revisited and attempted to reassess the historical veracity of its claim that the &quot;construction of the monastery began in 6853 (1344/1345)&quot;. The Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 endowment &ndash; a domed church with a developed cross-in-square plan and a narthex &ndash; represents a mature concept that combines several earlier achievements of church architecture (spatial uniting of the naos and the narthex, harmonious proportions, marked verticality). It is one of the finest representatives of the architectural style characteristic of a group of churches in the Skopje region (Ljuboten, Ku\u010devi&scaron;te, Matei\u010d, Matka, Modri&scaron;te). Their stylistic features unite Byzantine architectural developments of Constantinopolitan provenance, which made their way to Skopje via Thessaloniki, and Romanesque and proto-Gothic architectural trends from the Adriatic Littoral, whose influence was felt in Prizren, another important medieval center geographically and culturally associated with Skopje. A particularly interesting feature is the blend of several architectural methods and forms: the Byzantine construction method (stone and brick); the Constantinopolitan type of apse with double niches; the Romanesque concept of the western fa&ccedil;ade; and the Romanesque-Gothic window frames. All of this suggests a unique &ndash; and in some segments eclectic &ndash; concept that bears evidence to the changes in the architectural trends of the southern regions of the Serbian Empire in the third quarter of the 14th century. Therefore the view that the preconditions for the construction of such a representative endowment were met upon Vuka&scaron;in&rsquo;s coronation (1365/1366) and that it was completed before his death in 1371 seem sound.<br />\r\nThe striking thematic complexity and multi-layered iconography of the wall paintings from the Palaiologan era are most comprehensively assessed through the methodological perspective of iconographical analysis. The fresco program of the Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 endowment also reveals elements taken from ideological, literary, theological and liturgical teachings and practices. The content and meaning of the frescoes at Markov Manastir provide answers to certain important questions about the new stage in the relationship between the liturgy and the design of painted decorations of Byzantine churches. The program of Markov Manastir is a striking example of the last stage in the development of Byzantine art, which showed a strong influence of liturgical services and court ceremony on the content and arrangement of the thematic program (Christ the Archpriest in the composition of the Great Entrance in the sanctuary; the Royal De&euml;sis and the Heavenly Court; the last stanzas of the Akathistos cycle; the Passion cycle; the Calendar; The Feast of Holy Wisdom, etc.).<br />\r\nPoetry was a remarkably important source of inspiration for the contents and conceptual emphases of these paintings, since notable motifs from hymns, canons, troparia, psalms and prayers could be transformed into imagery or represented as an inscribed formula in several thematic ensembles (the Virgin&rsquo;s Akathistos, representations of the dead Christ and the mourning Virgin, the church&rsquo;s patron in the lunette above the west entrance, the inscriptions on the arches below the dome, etc.). This suggests that the frescoes of Markov Manastir reveal a subtle and ambiguous relationship between image and text, which had been adopted in the Serbian milieu from Byzantine culture. The remarkable erudition of the person who designed the fresco program of Markov Manastir is also apparent in the relationship toward the cult of the holy patron and the visual concept of his images above the west and south entrances, which have no parallels or prototypes in medieval Orthodox art. Another noteworthy feature is the documentary value of the frescoes at the most important Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 endowment (the donor portraits), especially given the fact that they date from a period in Serbian history which has left very few diplomatic or other written sources. Two groups of painters frescoed the Church of St. Demetrios; of different stylistic expressions, they are believed to have been trained in Ohrid and Skopje respectively. The Ohrid painters gave the painted program its distinctive artistic character.

    "text":"<p><em>By Dragan Vojvodi\u0107 |&nbsp;University of Belgrade; Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe first <em>ktetor</em> of the Ascension Church of \u017di\u010da Monastery was the Serbian grand <em>\u017eupan</em> Stefan (later the First-Crowned king), who began building it as his funerary church after 1207. The construction and decoration of its older part, overseen by Stefan&rsquo;s younger brother St. Sava, anointed the first archbishop of the Serbian autocephalous church in 1219, were completed by 1221. Having become the seat of the archbishopric, the church hosted a great ecclesiastical-political council in 1221, when Stefan was probably crowned for the second time, now according to the Orthodox rite, with a royal crown received from Rome.<br />\r\nThe naos of the church is divided into three bays. The central bay is topped by a dome and expanded with rectangular choirs. The sanctuary extends to the east with a large semicircular apse; in the west is the narthex with two lateral <em>parekklesia </em>(the southern one dedicated to Stephen the Protomartyr and the northern one to Sabas the Sanctified). Following the Byzantine tradition, \u017di\u010da&rsquo;s fa&ccedil;ades were plastered and painted purple. The original frescoes, best preserved in the choirs, were painted by learned and gifted artists from Thessaloniki or Constantinople. Their style belongs to the progressive trends of the then new, &ldquo;monumental&rdquo; style of Byzantine painting. Adjoining the older part of the church, a two-level exonarthex with a high tower on the frontage was added; the wall that originally separated the naos from the narthex was later removed. The exonarthex and the room on the tower&rsquo;s second story were frescoed before 1227 by local painters rather loyal to the outdated Komnenian artistic idioms.<br />\r\n\u017di\u010da and its <em>katholikon</em> were heavily damaged in a Cuman invasion ca. 1291. As a result, the seat of the Serbian Church was moved to Pe\u0107. Multiple groups of painters executed \u017di\u010da&rsquo;s new frescoes emulating the Palaiologan style and largely repeating the original program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe church is the first mature achievement of Ra&scaron;kan architectural concepts and would have a decisive influence on later Serbian religious architecture. Like the slightly older churches of Ra&scaron;ka (Studenica, \u0110ur\u0111evi Stupovi), \u017di\u010da&rsquo;s <em>katholikon</em> unites the basically Byzantine iconography of the interior with the shaping of masses and fa&ccedil;ade articulation derived from Western architecture. Important novelties include the rectangular choirs that replaced the earlier vestibules, the addition of lateral <em>parekklesia</em> adjoining the narthex, and the subsequently built exonarthex with a belfry, resulting in a distinctive solution characteristic of high Ra&scaron;kan architecture of the entire 13th century and some 14th-century Nemanji\u0107 mausolea. Like the sanctuaries of some Ra&scaron;kan churches built shortly thereafter (Mile&scaron;eva, Virgin of Hvosno), \u017di\u010da&rsquo;s <em>katholikon</em> originally had no <em>pastophoria</em>. All of these churches soon received a <em>prothesis</em> and <em>diakonikon</em>, both of which were routinely built in later Ra&scaron;kan churches.<br />\r\nThe unusual thematic program of the frescoes at \u017di\u010da&rsquo;s Ascension Church is particularly important for understanding the role of imagery in explaining the ecclesiological bases of the establishment of the new autocephalous Church. Even though only a few scenes of the original program have survived, it can be reliably reconstructed based on the more recent 14th-century frescoes and the fact that St. Sava&rsquo;s successor, Archbishop Arsenije, faithfully replicated the iconography at the Holy Apostles in Pe\u0107 (ca. 1260).<br />\r\nThe dome features the Ascension and the space below it shows the Gospel events that precede (<em>Last Supper</em>, <em>Incredulity of Thomas</em>, <em>Blessing at Bethany</em>) and follow it (<em>Descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles</em>). They speak of Christ imparting his teaching on the apostles, the establishment of the earthly church and its connection with the Heavenly Tabernacle. As a counterpoint to the events associated with Christ&rsquo;s ascension into Heaven, some scenes below the dome allude to the First Coming (<em>Annunciation to Zechariah </em>and <em>Annunciation to the Virgin</em>), while the representations of the other Great Feasts are reserved for the lower zones. The listed scenes are positioned in the uppermost parts of the church to highlight the importance of the union of God and man and the inseparability of the heavenly and earthly church maintained through apostolic succession.<br />\r\nThe fresco program around the two episcopal thrones at \u017di\u010da testified that this succession and apostolic mission among his people made St. Sava, the first Serbian archbishop, equal to Christ&rsquo;s disciples and gave the Serbian Church an apostolic character. The throne beside the eastern side of the southwestern pillar is surrounded by the standing figures of the Twelve Apostles in the lowest zone of the choirs and topped by the Descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles on the southern wall. Directly facing the High Place with a semicircular <em>synthronon</em>, on the western wall of the space below the dome, there is a semicircular scene of the Last Supper. This would have made the primate of the Serbian Church and his co-officiants seem like a live reenactment of the icon of the original Eucharistic meeting in the Cenacle. The same ecclesiological explanations are evident in the oration delivered by St. Sava, the ideational architect of \u017di\u010da&rsquo;s thematic program, at the great council of 1221.<br />\r\nThe two-level exonarthex of \u017di\u010da&rsquo;s <em>katholikon</em> with the belfry is believed to have been added to allow the church to serve as the archbishopric cathedral and coronation church. The purpose of the room on the tower&rsquo;s second story is unclear. The program of its paintings is inconsistent with that of a <em>parekklesion</em>. Since the program was devised by St. Sava, he might have used the room for prayerful seclusion. The figures of six Nemanji\u0107 family members, Sava&rsquo;s saintly exemplars and the Crucifixion adorn its walls. The frescoes on the ground level of the tower (1309&ndash;16) emphasize the multi-layered symbolism of the church doorway as the entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven. They partially repeat the original program but also include new themes. The eastern wall features an illustration of the Christmas <em>sticheron</em> with two processions in the lower part led by King Milutin and Archbishop Sava III. Emphasizing their patronage of \u017di\u010da as an expression of the symphonic synergy of secular and religious authority, this image represents them as the leaders of the Serbian people into the eschatological kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\n\u010canak-Medi\u0107, Milka, and Olivera Kandi\u0107. <em>L&rsquo;architecture de la premi&egrave;re moiti&eacute; du XIIIe si&egrave;cle I: &Eacute;glises de Rascie (Monuments de l&rsquo;architecture m&eacute;dievale serbe: Corpus des &eacute;difices sacraux)</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Yannis D. Varalis and </em><em>Constantine Dolmas |&nbsp;University of Thessaly</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe cover of this Gospel Lectionary (dim. 29.5 &times; 20.8 &times; 9 cm) is made of two wooden boards enveloped with purple velvet. Metal cast plaques and filigree stripes, partly gilded and enameled with cobalt, light blue, green, and pineapple yellow are nailed with pins on the front board. Three cherubs and a bicephalous eagle border the central plaque with the <em>Crucifixion</em>; four roundels with the symbols of the Evangelists are set in the corners; and twelve small panels with scenes of the Dodekaorton are fixed along the perimeter; sixteen autumn orange and nine olive green gemstones, transparent or opaque, are set on all plaques and stripes. The back board is covered by a perforated silver sheet and bordered by stripes with foliage partially gilded and rendered in repouss&eacute;. The same roundels with Evangelists&rsquo; symbols are set around the central plate, which bears the representation of the enthroned Christ amidst busts of the apostles set in a scroll. The dedicatory inscription is split in twelve parts, each on a metal plate between the cherubs and the panels of the front cover; the letters and the guide-lines are made with twisted wire. Nowadays the Gospel book is kept at the church of St. Nicholas at Retziani, the modern village of Metaxochori in the region of Aghia, Thessaly, and is preserved in quite good condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe Lectionary contains the basic passages from the Gospels that are read aloud and rhythmically during the Divine Liturgy. The Gospel Lectionary is usually decorated in most lavish forms, because it has a major processional and ostentatious role when it is carried ceremoniously from the prothesis to the altar table in the Lesser Introit or &laquo;Little Entrance&raquo;; it contained the Word of the Lord, who was the Logos (the Word) of God. Written late antique sources mention Gospel covers made of silver and gold with precious stones, pearls and/or ivory. Examples include the Gospel carried by the deacon to Maximianus&rsquo; left in the famous mosaic with Justinian and his retinue at San Vitale, Ravenna, dating from the mid-6th century, and the Gospel cover of Queen Theodelinda, kept at the Museum and Treasury of the Monza cathedral, dated to the late 6th or early 7th century. Later, the Gospel books were usually covered by copper alloy, silver or gold sheets that enveloped the outer faces of the binding boards. These sheets, cast or in repouss&eacute;, enameled and/or gilt, displayed a surface in relief, often split in panels, the central and largest of which contained a representation of Christ or the Virgin while the flanking squares contained busts of saints and apostles. From the thirteenth century onward, the iconography of the Gospel book covers became more established: the <em>Crucifixion</em> is set in the middle of the front and the <em>Descent into Hell</em> in the middle of the back cover, as is indicated by the Gospel book covers of the Protaton church and the Great Lavra Monastery, on Mount Athos, the Marciana Library, Venice, and the National History Museum, Sofia. As has already been observed, such an arrangement of the repertoire echoes the organization of the iconographic subjects on the precious revetments of Palaiologan icons; in most cases such revetments comprise border bands with medallions or squares with Dodekaorton scenes and/or busts of saints.<br />\r\nWhat is new in the Dimos&rsquo; Lectionary binding is the plethora of metal plaques nailed on the boards, especially on the front. This kind of decoration derives from Byzantine book covers where few fittings are placed at the center and in the corners, so as to retain and decorate the leather or the velvet that envelops the boards. Plentiful silver-gilt fittings are very rare, like in the mid-13th century Bardzrberd Gospels. The technique and style of Dimos is found in more than fifteen book covers which are recorded in churches and monasteries in Thessaly and in the Skiathos and Andros Islands, as well as at the Byzantine and Christian Museum, Athens. These Gospel book covers seem to have been generated by the same Retziani workshop, in which goldsmith Dimos may have played an important role, in the last quarter of the 17th and the first half of the 18th century. Some of its products seem to have reached monasteries of a certain reputation, like the Gospel book covers of the Ba\u010dkovo monastery, Bulgaria, and the upper parts of the crosses of Stefan Uro&scaron; De\u010danski and Stefan Du&scaron;an at the Decani monastery, Serbia, dated to the 17th century; on these book covers and crosses we find the same small metal icons enameled with blue and light green. The dedicatory inscriptions displayed on book covers, chalices, fans, procession crosses and icon revetments produced by this Retziani workshop preserve not only the names of silversmiths and their towns of origin, but also attest to the names of the wealthy donors, mostly clerics, who wished to refurbish their churches with ecclesiastical silver from a renowned local workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Inscription(s)</strong><br />\r\n\u1f18&tau;&omicron;\u1fe6|&tau;&omicron; &tau;\u1f78 &theta;\u1fc6&omicron;&nu; &kappa;\u1f72 | \u1f21&epsilon;&rho;\u1f78&nu; \u1f10&beta;&alpha;&gamma;&gamma;\u03ad|&lambda;&eta;&omicron; &epsilon;(\u1f36&nu;)|&epsilon; \u1f00&pi;\u1f78 &tau;[&lsquo;] | (&Rho;\u03ad)&tau;&zeta;&alpha;&nu;[&eta;] | \u1f00&pi;\u1f78 &tau;\u1f78&nu; &Pi;&rho;&omicron;|&phi;\u03ae&tau;&eta; \u1f38&lambda;\u03ae&alpha; [&delta;&iota;\u1f70] | (&sigma;&upsilon;&nu;)&delta;&rho;&omicron;(&mu;\u1fc6&sigmaf;) &Kappa;&omicron;&mu;(&eta;)&nu;|\u03ac&nu;&eta;&sigmaf; &Kappa;\u03cc&mu;&eta;&nu;&epsilon; \u1f31&epsilon;&rho;\u03ad&omicron;&sigmaf; | &Sigma;\u03ae&mu;&omicron;&nu; \u1f21&epsilon;&rho;\u03ad&omicron;&sigmaf; | &kappa;\u1f72 &epsilon;\u1f50&kappa;&iota;\u03ac&sigma;&tau;&eta; \u1f00|&pi;\u1f78 &chi;&eta;&rho;(\u1f78&sigmaf;) &Delta;\u03ae&mu;&omicron;&upsilon; | \u1f00&pi;\u1f78 &tau;\u1f74&nu; &Rho;\u03ad&tau;&zeta;&alpha;|&nu;&eta; &kappa;\u1f72 &nu;\u1f70 &mu;&nu;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&nu;\u03ad&beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu;&tau;&epsilon; &pi;\u03ac&nu;&tau;&omicron;|&tau;&epsilon; \u1f10&pi;\u1f74 \u1f14&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf; \u1f00&pi;\u1f78 &Chi;(&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;)\u1fe6 &sbquo;&alpha;&chi;&omicron;&gamma;&rsquo;. &laquo;This divine and holy Gospel is [dedicated] to the church of Prophet Elijah at Retziani [by] the expense of the priest Komenanis &lt;Komine&gt;, [and] of the priest Simon and was made by the hand of Dimos of Retziani, [in order to] commemorate [the donors] forever, in the year of the Lord 1673&raquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nBallian,&nbsp;Anna.&nbsp;&quot;Silverwork produced in Ottoman Trikala (Thessaly): Problems of Taxonomy and Interpretation.&quot; In&nbsp;<em>Ottoman Metalwork in the Balkans and in Hungary.&nbsp;</em>Edited by&nbsp;Ibolya Gerelyes and Maximilian Hartmuth, 11&ndash;35.

    "text":"<p><em>By Margarita Voulgaropoulou | Ruhr Universit&auml;t Bochum</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe icon of Our Lady Skopiotissa from Savina Monastery, Montenegro centers on the Virgin Mary in a glory formed of clouds, holding the Christ Child on her lap, and surrounded by angels and cherubs. A bilingual inscription in Latin and Greek identifies her as <em>Skopiotissa</em>, a variant of the <em>Hodegetria</em> created in Zakynthos. At the top of a hill on the left, the Archangel Michael is depicted holding a skull and raising his sword, a theme commonly associated with the plague in the Catholic tradition. Above him, an inscription in Latin alludes to the salvation of Zakynthos from an outbreak of the plague that occurred in July 1647 under the administration of <em>provveditore</em> Girolamo Trevisan (1647&ndash;49), whose coats of arms are depicted on the top left corner. A Cyrillic rendition of the inscription can be seen on the Virgin&rsquo;s right side. Alongside the angel, the donor, a certain Stefan Tomi\u0107 from Herceg Novi (Castelnuovo), is kneeling in prayer in front of the Virgin, beseeching her protection, according to a Cyrillic inscription below him. The entire lower part of the composition displays a detailed view of the fortified city of Zakynthos identified by a bilingual inscription in Latin and Greek, featuring several topographic elements such as the Minotto bastion, erected in 1646. The mention of the 1647 plague suggests a dating for the icon around the middle or in the second half of the 17th century. The icon can be attributed to a painter active in Zakynthos, possibly associated with the workshop of Elias and Leos Moskos, who migrated to the island after the Ottoman conquest of Rethymno in 1646.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe iconographic type of the <em>Skopiotissa </em>originates from an icon of the Virgin that was venerated at the monastery of Our Lady of Mount Skopos on the island of Zakynthos. Considered miraculous, the icon was invoked in times of epidemic outbreaks and natural disasters, while it was also famed for protecting seamen from accidents at sea. From the mid-17th and especially during the 18th century, the Virgin&rsquo;s cult grew immensely in popularity and was disseminated from Zakynthos and the Ionian Islands to the maritime societies of the Adriatic region. Icons reproducing the type of the <em>Skopiotissa</em> were venerated in numerous islands and ports of the East Adriatic coast, mainly in Dalmatia and the Bay of Kotor, reflecting the intense cultural and commercial exchanges between the Venetian territories of the Southern Adriatic and Ionian Seas.<br />\r\nThe presently discussed icon offers one of the earliest depictions of the <em>Skopiotissa</em>, following the type of the <em>Hodegetria</em>, instead of the later iconographic type that portrayed the Virgin in bust with her hands crossed in her chest. The donor of the icon, Stefan Tomi\u0107, was in all probability a merchant or sailor who was saved from the 1647 plague while in Zakynthos and commissioned the painting to protect him &ldquo;from future calamities and in the Last Judgement.&rdquo; After returning to his homeland, Tomi\u0107 donated the icon as a votive offering to Savina monastery, near his native town of Herceg Novi. Traders and seamen like Tomi\u0107, who frequented the major port-cities of the Ionian and Adriatic Seas, often brought back souvenirs from holy sites they visited, such as devotional icons and ex-votos. Those images they either carried with them in their travels or they donated them to monasteries and sanctuaries of their homelands, beseeching the divine protection from the dangers of their profession.<br />\r\nThe veneration of icons, therefore, brought together the diverse elements that made up the multicultural and multiconfessional societies of the Adriatic. At the meeting point of the Orthodox Balkans, and the Ionian and Adriatic Seas, the Bay of Kotor had become the setting of intense cross-cultural exchanges between populations of diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds as early as the Late Middle Ages. One of the most illustrative examples of the ethno-confessional and cultural pluralism of the region and perhaps the only comparable case to the Savina icon is that of the dual Church of the Virgin or of St. Basil in Mr\u017eep (1451), which was decorated in a mixed Byzantine and Late Gothic style and iconography, and bore inscriptions in Latin, Greek and Cyrillic.<br />\r\nThis ethno-confessional amalgamation became even more pronounced from the 17th century onwards. Especially during the Cretan war (1645&ndash;69), the demographic consistency of the Bay of Kotor underwent a dramatic change, due to the mass migration of Orthodox populations that were pushed towards the Adriatic coast as the Ottomans were advancing into the Montenegrin hinterland. In 1645 the Orthodox Christians of the region rose to around 1,000 in a total population of 5,000, whereas another 2,000 Orthodox refugees arrived in the lands of the bishopric of Kotor in 1662. These mobilities fostered a dynamic of coexistence and acculturation that extended from bilingualism and linguistic assimilation, to mixed marriages, and instances of shared worship (<em>communicatio in sacris</em>). Echoing these developments, devotional images from that time would feature bilingual inscriptions in Greek and Latin, or, from the late 17th century onwards, Cyrillic, to be understood by the different ethnic and linguistic groups. In this context, the icon of the <em>Skopiotissa</em> from Savina Monastery stands out among similar contemporary works as it presents a rare case of a cultural and linguistic trilingualism. Created by a Greek painter for a Slavic-speaking, but possibly Catholic donor, and bearing inscriptions in three different languages, i.e. in Greek, Latin, and Cyrillic, the Savina Virgin uniquely reflects the cultural symbiosis of the Italian, Greek, and Slavic elements of the Bay of Kotor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Inscription(s)</strong><br />\r\nLA BEATISIMA [sic] VE(RG)I/NE DI (SCO)PO: The most blessed Virgin of Skopos.<br />\r\nH &Mu;&Alpha;&Kappa;&Alpha;&Rho;&Iota;&Omega;&Tau;&Alpha;&Tau;&Eta; &Pi;&Alpha;&Rho;&Theta;&Epsilon;&Nu;&Omicron;C / &Epsilon;&Kappa; &Tau;&Omicron;&Upsilon; C&Kappa;&Omicron;&Pi;\u0222: The most blessed Virgin of Skopos.<br />\r\nLA CITA ET ISOLA DEL ZAN/TE: The city and the island of Zakynthos.<br />\r\n\u1f29 &Pi;&Omicron;&Lambda;&Iota;C &Kappa;&Alpha;&Iota; &Nu;&Eta;COC &Tau;&Eta;C &Zeta;&Alpha;&Kappa;&Upsilon;&Nu;&Theta;\u0222: The city and the island of Zakynthos.<br />\r\nLIBERATA FUIT &Agrave; / PESTI MEN.

    "text":"<p><em>By Olga Yunak | Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Church of the Transfiguration of Our Savior on Ilyina Street is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and part of the museum complex that includes several other historical monuments in and around Veliky Novgorod (Novgorod thereafter), Russian Federation. The Church of the Transfiguration occupies a prominent place in the architectural landscape of the city. Characterized by exquisite harmony and simplicity, this church is a prime example of Novgorodian church architecture of the 14th century. This particular architectural style has its origins in Byzantium but also carries elements of Gothic aesthetics mixed with local building traditions. The amalgamation of styles attests to the unique position of the city as an economic and cultural hub connecting the European West and the Byzantine East.<br />\r\nThe Church of the Transfiguration is located on the market side of Novgorod, just a short walk from the eastern gate of the city&rsquo;s Kremlin and its main cathedral, St. Sophia (11th century). This church is one of the oldest buildings in Novgorod. The original wooden building (1103), which was rebuilt in stone in 1374, housed the miracle-working icon of the Mother of God <em>Znamenie</em>, the most venerated icon in Novgorod. In 1378, Theophanes the Greek (ca. 1340 &ndash; ca. 1410) decorated the newly-built church. Theophanes, originally from Constantinople, is considered the most extraordinary iconographer of 14th-century Russia, emerging before Andrey Rublev and the myriad of notable painters of the Russian &ldquo;Renaissance&rdquo; that took place in the following century. The church on Ilyina Street in Novgorod is the only church whose surviving frescoes can be attributed with certainty to Theophanes. For the most part, Theophanes followed traditional church decoration canons, but he also introduced some unusual for Novgorod elements such as the Passion Cycle in the altar space. A small chamber in the upper gallery of the church displays the most complete iconographic program, offering a glimpse into Theophanes&rsquo;s visionary genius.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe Church of the Transfiguration on Ilyina Street held a special place in the religious life of Novgorod. Chronicles attest to the fact that Archbishop Alexi (d. 1389) and the higher clergy of St. Sophia were present at the consecration of the church in 1378. Years later, Cyprian, the Metropolitan of All Russia and Lithuania (d. 1406), stopped there before proceeding to the main cathedral of St. Sophia. Both events indicate that the church on Ilyina Street was not simply another small neighborhood church, but an important landmark in the political landscape of the region.<br />\r\nChronicles record that the &ldquo;God-loving citizen of Novgorod,&rdquo; Vasily Danilovich Mashkov, and &ldquo;the neighboring community&rdquo; commissioned the decoration of the church on Ilyina Street. This building belongs to the group of city churches that are collectively known as boyar churches. Indeed, the late 14th century witnessed the strengthening of the position of <em>boyars</em> (nobles whose rank was second to that of a prince), which contributed to the rapid growth of city churches. Other ecclesiastical buildings in this category are the Church of St. Theodore Stratelates on the Spring (1360&ndash;61), the Church of the Transfiguration of Our Savior on Torzhok (1364), the Church of the Virgin&rsquo;s Nativity on Molotkovo (1379), and the Church of the Holy Trinity in Pskov (1365&ndash;67).<br />\r\nThe architecture of the boyar churches&mdash;including the Church of the Transfiguration &mdash;exhibits a curious blending of palatial and monastic styles. Just as in the past local princes had built their palace churches with a privileged access to the upper galleries for private viewing of the liturgy, well-off <em>boyar</em> families commissioned their own churches with private chambers in the galleries designated for special services for their families. Also, in imitation of monastic traditions, these chambers were designed to recall the cell of an ascetic and to be used for private contemplations by those &ldquo;exhibiting high spiritual authority.&rdquo; The iconography of these churches often reflected this new trend of laity imitating monastic spiritual practices. The chamber in the church on Ilyina Street, in particular, features an unusually high concentration of images of ascetics, rendered in an austere, almost monochromatic, style of painting. &nbsp;<br />\r\nTheophanes the Greek was already a well-established artist who had worked on churches in Constantinople, Chalcedon, Galatia, and Kaffa before arriving in Novgorod. Like many other artists from Constantinople and Thessaloniki, he traveled through the Byzantine peripheries, bringing with him painting practices refined by the capital&rsquo;s sensibilities. According to one legend, Theophanes was traveling through the Crimea when he met a Novgorodian bishop who convinced him to come to Novgorod. It is also quite plausible that he came to Russia in the <em>entourage</em> accompanying the future metropolitan Cyprian, a <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute; </em>of the hesychastic patriarch Philotheos Kokkinos (d. 1379).<br />\r\nThe Church of the Transfiguration on Ilyina Street stands out not only because of its alignment with the city&rsquo;s ruling circles, but also because of Theophanes&rsquo;s style. Many scholars consider his work in Novgorod contributing to the development of a freer, more energetic painting style that came out of Constantinople and was transformed by the local pictorial traditions of the peripheries into a technical and spiritual <em>tour de force</em> of its own kind. Theophanes&rsquo;s painting style&mdash;reduced color scheme and intense linearity&mdash;endows his characters with the enormous internal tension and reveals their spiritual strength.<br />\r\nScholars have speculated about the sources of Theophanes&rsquo;s unusual style and its theological underpinnings ever since his frescoes were first uncovered in 1910&ndash;12. Although his style is unique, it can be placed within the context of other monuments in the Byzantine peripheries. The examples of this style can be found in the already-mentioned Stratelates Church in Novgorod, the Church of the Assumption on Volotovo Field in Novgorod (1352), the Church of the Protective Veil of the Virgin at Dormotovo in Pskov (mid-14th century), the Church of Christ the Savior in Tsalenjikha, Georgia (1384&ndash;96), the Church of Ayios Nikolaos at Cheili on Tilos, Greece (early 15th century). To date, there is no systematic study of this corpus. The question as to where Theophanes fits into the bigger context of the Byzantine and European art of his time remains open to investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nAlpatov, Mikhail Vladimirovich. <em>Feofan Grek = Theophanes the Greek. </em>Moscow: Izobrazitel\u02b9noe iskusstvo, 1979.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">The author of this book offers a new look at both Theophanes&rsquo;s frescoes in Novgorod and other monumental works, works on paper, and panels attributed to Theophanes in Moscow and elsewhere.</p><p>Grabar\u02b9, I.\u0116. &ldquo;Feofan Grek.

    "text":"<p><em>By Elias Petrou | University of California, Irvine</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nThe codex <em>Oxoniensis Barocc. gr. 87</em> contains various philosophical treatises, and it was used as a Byzantine teaching textbook in 15th century Constantinople. It comprises 353 paper leaves, bound in quaternia (sets of four paper leaves), and copied by various hands. The main work of the codex is Aristotle&#39;s <em>Organon</em> (f. 35r until the end), accompanied by multiple introductory logical treatises such as Michael Psellus&#39; <em>paraphrasis</em> in Aristotle&#39;s Categories (f. 3v), Porphyrius&#39; <em>Isagoge</em> with scholia (f. 18r), and Ammonius&#39; <em>Vita </em>of Aristotle (f. 30r). The content, the <em>scholia</em>, and the various <em>schemata</em> on the margins indicate its use as a teaching textbook - e.g., the <em>schema</em>/diagram of f. 122r visualizes part of Aristotle&#39;s work <em>Analytica Priora</em> (&sect; 44a), making it more understandable by the students. <em>Terminus ante quem </em>should be the mid. 15th century. The manuscript&#39;s importance lies in the elaborate, colorful image of f. 33v, depicting the scholar Ioannes Argyropoulos teaching at the Xenon of the Kral. The famous scholar is sitting on a luxurious armchair throne, wearing a red gown with gold details on his shoulders and sleeves along with a tall silver headpiece, indicating his position as a teacher. His right hand is holding a short staff surmounted with red ornaments, while his left hand is pointing to an open codex on a solid bookstand that contains writing tools in a niche at its base. Thanks to the high-quality digital reproduction analysis, I identified the copied text in the open book, which was written in three lines. It is the first verse of Aristotle&#39;s <em>Categories </em>(&sect; 1a, lin. 1): &quot;\u1f49&mu;\u03ce&nu;&upsilon;&mu;&alpha; | &lambda;\u03ad&gamma;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota; \u1f67&nu; | \u1f44&nu;&omicron;&mu;&alpha; &mu;\u03cc&nu;&omicron;&nu; / Things are said to be named &#39;equivocally&#39; when.&quot;&nbsp;Three Greek inscriptions identify the illustration&#39;s location along with the teacher and his students (I. upper margin; II. behind the sitting figure; III. right margin; for the transcriptions, see below). Although the name &quot;Aristotle&quot; was added above the sitting figure&#39;s head, it was crossed out by two lines and replaced by the inscription II, renaming the teacher as Argyropoulos. It is unknown whether the two buildings in the background, a tall tower and a lower construction with a peaked roof, depict the Xenon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nThe codex <em>Oxoniensis Barocc. gr. 87</em> is one of the most important pieces of evidence of the intellectual relationship and exchange between Byzantium and Serbia from the 14th century onward. Its connections to the Xenon of the Kral in Constantinople, and the teaching institute there, indicate the strong cultural bond between the two states for almost two centuries.<br />\r\nThe Xenon was founded by the Serbian Kral Uros II Milutin (r. 1281&ndash;1321), probably after his marriage with Emperor Andronicos II&#39;s (r. 1282&ndash;1328) six-year-old daughter, the Byzantine princess, Simonis, in Thessalonica in 1299. The complex was located in the north-west part of the city, close to the Aetios&#39; cistern and next to the monastery of St. John Prodromos &quot;en Petra&quot;. In addition to its primary function as Xenon (Inn), a hospital was established on its premises, and a scriptorium and binding workshop of manuscripts can be related to the institution. Various scholars and scribes appear to have been active there. The copyists Theodoros Prodromenos, George Chrysokokkes, George Vaiophoros, and Stephanos of Media prepared manuscripts with secular and ecclesiastical content at the scriptorium, while the famous scholar John Chortasmenos restored (rebound) the cod. <em>Vind. Med. gr.</em> 1 at the expense of a monk at the Xenon, namely Nathanael, in 1406.<br />\r\nThe existence of a school at the Xenon can be verified only during the last decade of the Byzantine Empire. The letter (<em>Prosfonima</em>) of the scholar Michael Apostoles to Ioannes Argyropoulos, dated after 1444, mentioned Ioannes&#39; imperial appointment as a teacher at the Xenon of the Kral, along with parts of his teaching curriculum. The manuscript of the present case study should be considered as contemporary to Apostoles&#39; letter due to its content, epigrams, and depiction on f. 33v. According to its content (brief introduction to Aristotle&#39;s <em>Organon</em> - f. 1r, Part of Aristotle&#39;s physical problems - f. 2r, Michael Psellus&#39; <em>paraphrasis</em> in Aristotle&#39;s Categories - f. 3v, Porphyrius&#39; <em>Isagoge</em> with scholia - f. 18r), Ammonius&#39; Vita of Aristotle - f. 30r,<em> De iis in omni arte et scientia quaerendis </em>- f. 31r, and Aristotle&#39;s <em>Organon</em> - f. 35r), it served as a teaching textbook at the specific school on the subject of philosophy. The epigram on the upper margin of Argyropoulos&#39; depiction identifies some of the students there: &quot;Argyropoulos (is) teaching the physician Antonios Pyropoullos and Marcos Pyropoullos, along with the physician John Panaretos, and Demetrios Angelos, and Aggalona, the son of Moschos, the physician Vranas of the first master at the Xenon of the Kral.&quot; The same names were included in a similar epigram, copied on the upper margin of the f. 178v of the cod. <em>Marc. Class. V. 9</em> strengthening the hypothesis of the existence of a school at the Xenon: &quot;Diagram of John Argyropoulos, the philosopher and teacher, when we were studying next to him at the Xenon of the Kral the science of Galenos, me and sir Antonios Pyropoullos and sir John Panaretos and sir Manuel Pyropoullos, the son of Jacob, and Vranas, the son of the first master, and sir Maroules and sir Manuel and Andronicos Dioscurides, who is called eparchos.&quot; After Constantinople&#39;s fall, many of these scholars, including Argyropoulos, moved to the West and the Balkans as distinguished academics, scholars, and physicians.<br />\r\nWith all the above characteristics in mind, the <em>Barrocianus</em> can be considered a unique case study, not only from historical and cultural standpoints but also from a paleographical perspective. During the Palaeologan era, Byzantine textbooks on various subjects can be identified through their subjects and the various <em>scholia</em> and interlinear <em>glossae</em>. Few cases mention the names of the students and/or the teachers, either through notes or epigrams on various folia. Even fewer cases mention the places in which the teaching and learning were taking place. This case study&#39;s manuscript is probably one of the few examples that identifies all three of the above (the teacher, the students, and their school), transforming it into a vital source for understanding scholarship in the Byzantine capital of the 15th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nCataldi Palau, Annaclara. &quot;Learning Greek in Fifteenth-century Constantinople.&quot; In <em>Studies in Greek Manuscripts</em> (Testi, Studi, Strumenti 1), 219&ndash;234.

    "text":"<p><em>By Ovidiu Olar </em>|&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;N. Iorga&rdquo; Institute of History of the Romanian Academy, Bucharest</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nIn the late 12th century, the theologian Peter of Poitiers (&dagger; 1205) created a historical summary of Christ&rsquo;s genealogy, written in Latin. Systematizing centuries of biblical exegesis, he designed the composition as a pedagogical tool. The result &ndash; a compilation of biblical history from the Creation of the World to the Ascension of Christ &ndash; proved enormously popular and influential throughout the late medieval and early modern periods. Continuously extended, this representative of &ldquo;diagrammatic chronicles&rdquo; (Andrea Worm) survived in several versions and languages, transmitted by dozens of manuscripts and rolls. Some of the items belong to the deluxe category; others are of a lower quality.<br />\r\nOn the one hand, Peter of Poitiers&rsquo; compendium and its subsequent variants have generated an extensive scholarly literature. On the other hand, the genealogical chronicles of the Bible produced in 18th-century Southeast Europe have attracted limited attention. There are at least five such genealogies: three codices (in Athens [National Library of Greece (<em>&Epsilon;&theta;&nu;&iota;&kappa;\u03ae &Beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&theta;\u03ae&kappa;&eta; &tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &Epsilon;&lambda;&lambda;\u03ac&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf; </em>&ndash; henceforth EBE) Greek MS. 1892], Bucharest, and Kyiv) and two long rolls (in Bucharest and Princeton). Three are in Romanian and two in Greek. All of them start with the Creation and end with the Ascension, but the text and the miniatures vary.<br />\r\nBAR <em>ms. rom.</em> 5896 is a mid-18th century manuscript currently held in the Bucharest branch of the Library of the Romanian Academy (<em>Biblioteca Academiei Rom&acirc;ne</em> &ndash; henceforth BAR). It is made of several sheets of paper glued together to form a continuous horizontal scroll (1059 cm long and 44.5 cm high), which is kept in its original metallic tube. This is a &ldquo;genealogy from Adam to Christ&rdquo;, which depicts the most important characters of the Bible and the contemporary rulers up to the Judean king Herod Agrippa I (r. 41&ndash;44). The text, written in Romanian with Cyrillic script, runs from left to right. The roll is lavishly illustrated. It contains 504 medallion portraits in quill and ink color painting: the first, representing God the Father, has a diameter of 65 mm; the one representing Christ Emmanuel has a diameter of 46 mm; all the rest, including the group portrait of the 70 translators of the Septuagint, have a diameter of 30 mm. There are also seven drawings, including the Tabernacle surrounded by cities and the Tower of Babel. Finally, the depictions of the Nativity, Crucifixion, and Resurrection are placed within medallions with a diameter of 46 mm.<br />\r\nThe roll has been created by priest Flor (&ldquo;Popa Flor&rdquo;), most probably in Bucharest, the capital city of Wallachia, where the learned ecclesiast acted as teacher and head of the princely school at the St. George-the-Old Church (&ldquo;Sf&acirc;ntul Gheorghe Vechi&rdquo;). The item is not dated. However, Flor was a prolific translator from Greek and Church Slavonic, copyist, and scribe of the princely Wallachian chancellery; his activity can be continuously traced between (roughly) 1747 and April 1769. As a direct consequence, one can safely propose 1769 as a <em>terminus ante quem</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nBAR <em>ms. rom.</em> 5896 contains a genealogical chronicle from the Creation of the World to the Ascension of Christ. It focuses on the genealogy of Jesus, from Seth, the third son of Adam and Eve, onwards; it presents in parallel the bloodlines of Cain (until the Flood), of Mary, the future Mother of God (starting with Nathan, the son of King David), and of the contemporary Judean, Aramean, Assyrian, Chaldean, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman rulers. The structure follows closely the Bible and posits the existence of six ages of the World: the first period starts with Adam, while the last starts with Jesus.<br />\r\nIt is generally assumed that the Bucharest roll is a copy of an early 18th-century work by the Metropolitan of Wallachia Antim Ivireanul (&ldquo;the Iberian&rdquo;), kept in Kyiv, in the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine (DA 379L). Entitled <em>The Faces of the Old and New Testament </em>(&ldquo;Chipurile Vechiului \u0219i Noului Testament&rdquo;), written in T&acirc;rgovi\u0219te, dated 1 July 1709, and dedicated to the Wallachian prince Constantin Br&acirc;ncoveanu (r. 1688&ndash;1714), this text corresponds indeed for the most part to the one by priest Flor. Yet the dedication is missing, the first part is completely different, and the form has morphed: instead of an in-folio with the genealogical list formatted top-to-bottom, we are now facing a roll with the genealogy running left-to-right. Therefore, in spite of all textual and iconographic similarities, the two genealogical chronicles are quite different. (The relationship, which seems very close, with the manuscript in Athens is yet to be addressed.)<br />\r\nThey are by no means the only &ldquo;Wallachian&rdquo; representatives of the genre. Princeton Greek MS. 16 &ndash; a late 18th-century roll depicting the genealogy of the Savior, from the Creation (of Adam and Eve) to the Ascension (of Christ) &ndash; may also have originated in Wallachia. Longer and higher than the one by priest Flor (1373.4 x 55.5 cm), it combines several textual sources, such as the 12th-century Chronicle of Michael Glykas and the 18th-century works of Kaisarios Dapontes. Written in Greek and even more richly illuminated, with 562 illustrations, the roll runs left-to-right, from the top-down Genesis to the bottom-up Rise to the heavens.<br />\r\nWhat was the function of such rolls? For the moment, the answer remains elusive. They could have been intended as didactic tools for the students of the (Wallachian) princely schools: priest Flor was a teacher who trusted the educational value of the images (the seminal <em>Compendium</em> by Peter of Poitiers also had a pronounced didactic function). However, their deluxe nature makes this hypothesis the least probable. They might have been the result of an increased interest in sacred history, which went hand in hand with the desire to systematize, with the help of visual, diagrammatic strategies, all extant knowledge in the field: the explanatory texts are taken from different sources, such as the Bible, the apocrypha, the universal Byzantine and post-Byzantine chronicles. They may have mirrored the state of the art in the field of secular history, where the lists maintained a privileged status.<br />\r\nDid the rolls have a liturgical function? The thorough study of the textual fragments and of their relationship with the images will, undoubtedly, provide answers to questions like this. Yet irrespective of their intended role, BAR <em>ms. rom.</em> 5896 and Princeton Greek MS. 16 clearly mark a preference for a &ldquo;modern&rdquo; in form but &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; in content cartography of time. While Antim&rsquo;s <em>Faces of the Old and New Testament </em>favors the &ldquo;vertical time,&rdquo; the later rolls depart from the &ldquo;Tree&rdquo; type of genealogies and fancy a &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; approach. The preference given to the roll in the detriment of the codex is intriguing: it might have had apocalyptic undertones because it was believed that at the End of Time, the angels will roll up the roll of Time; it was definitely better suited to express the continuity of &ldquo;human&rdquo; time since the origins until the Redemption. Yet even more fascinating is the pronounced interest &ndash; understudied with respect to early modern Southeast Europe &ndash; in a type of (sacred) historical writing that combines text(s) and image(s) in order to deliver its Christian Bible-based message: the world was, is, and will forever be in God&rsquo;s hands.<br />\r\nSituated at the crossroads between the East and the West, ruled by a Greek-speaking Orthodox elite fully integrated in the Ottoman state apparatus, and highly coveted by Austria and Russia alike, 18th century Wallachia offers remarkable examples of linguistic and artistic creativity. Due to the interplay between text (in Romanian or in Greek), image, and medium (codex or roll), as well as to their possible &ldquo;Western&rdquo; influences, the genealogical chronicles showcased above count easily among the most interesting ones.<br />\r\nPrinceton&nbsp;Chronicle of Biblical History:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/3600046\">https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/3600046&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nAntim Ivireanul. <em>Opere </em>[Works], edited by&nbsp;Gabriel \u0218trempel, 239&ndash;321.

    "text":"<p><em>By Lilyana Yordanova |&nbsp;&Eacute;cole fran&ccedil;aise d&rsquo;Ath&egrave;nes </em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nThe Gospels of Ivan Alexander (r. 1331-1371) is a manuscript produced between 1355 and 1356 at the request of the ruler of the Second Bulgarian Tsardom. It contains 286 parchment leaves with the Four Gospels written in Cyrillic uncial, followed by a Menologion&nbsp;and Synaxaria, which were added in half-uncial between the second half of the 14th century and the initial decades of the 15th century. After the Ottoman conquest of the Bulgarian state in 1396, the Gospels manuscript found its way to Moldavia in the beginning of the 15th century.<br />\r\nTwo hundred years later it came into the possession of St. Paul Monastery on Mount Athos, from where Robert Curzon, 14th Baron of Zouche (1810-1873), acquired it in 1837. Bequeathed by his family to the British Museum in 1917, the Gospels manuscript finally entered the collections of the British Library in 1973 with the shelf-mark Add. Ms. 39627.<br />\r\nA masterpiece of late medieval book production, the codex impresses with its lavish decoration of 367 miniatures, 6 of which depict the Bulgarian Tsar. Apart from the opening full-page portrait of Ivan Alexander&rsquo;s family (ff. 2v-3r), the majority of images adopt a smaller, frieze format to accompany the evangelic texts. The latter are further enhanced by tables of contents with indications in gold and elaborated headpieces consisting of floral motives and depictions of Christ, the Evangelists and various prophets. The appropriation of Byzantine models can be clearly detected both in the miniatures and their layout. Another distinctive and rare feature of the manuscript is the &lsquo;word maze&rsquo; on f. 273v which reads &iota;\u1ff6 \u0430\u043b\u0435&xi;\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0463 \u0442\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0433\u0433\u0435\u043b (&lsquo;Gospels of Ivan Alexander&rsquo;). Only two other 14th-century Slavonic manuscripts include such a decorative element. According to the colophon, a now lost golden-plated book cover complemented the adornment of this exquisite object of piety and political affirmation (f. 274v).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nFrom an art historical perspective, the study of the Gospels of Tsar Ivan Alexander falls at the intersection of several seminal issues pertaining to the agency of objects, luxurious book production in the late Middle Ages and artistic exchanges across the Byzantine world.<br />\r\nThe Gospels manuscript was copied at a key moment in the history of the Balkan Peninsula following the Byzantine civil war of 1341-47. What started as an internal conflict for the throne between the infant heir John V Palaiologos (r. 1341&ndash;91) and the <em>megas domestikos</em>&nbsp;(military commander-in-chief) John Kantakuzenos (r. 1347&ndash;54), had a lasting impact on the power balance between the neighboring Slavic countries in the following decade. Kantakuzenos&rsquo; success, achieved through an alliance with the Serbian ruler Stefan Du&scaron;an (r. 1331-55) and the Ottoman Bey Orhan (r. 1324-61?) undermined the position of John V and that of his ally Ivan Alexander. The Tsar proved unsuccessful in challenging the leading position of Du&scaron;an, who already in 1344 appropriated a part of the Bulgarian imperial title. He also missed out on settling matters with Kantakuzenos over a previous conflict. By the end of 1355, however, the course of events changed. Du&scaron;an suddenly died in December of that year, Kantakuzenos had already abdicated in 1354, while John V&rsquo;s power was consolidated. According to a recent opinion, there is a correlation between Ivan Alexander&rsquo;s renewed authority among Christian rulers in the Balkans and the commission of the Gospels manuscript that emphasizes visually his military, devotional, and intellectual qualities.<br />\r\nPreviously considered as a work of the imperial scriptorium in the capital of Tarnovo, the codex rather displays similarities with the script and the ornamentation of contemporary Serbian manuscripts from Hilandar Monastery, including the Gospels Ms. 13, the Apostolos Ms. 46 and the Lectionary Ms. 17. At that time the Holy Mountain was a vibrant intellectual hub and an important center for book production. It could certainly have produced a manuscript of such ambition with the guidance of an experienced patron of the arts like Ivan Alexander to whom five more manuscripts can be attributed as well as the endowment of churches and monasteries in and outside the Tsardom.<br />\r\nAs a part of the so-called &ldquo;Paris Gr. 74 group&rdquo;, the Gospels manuscript played a key role in the development of Byzantine imagery of power by adapting the latter to the needs of the Bulgarian political agenda and by disseminating successfully the enhanced iconographic formulae in the north-Danubian Romanian lands. Ivan Alexander&rsquo;s commission could also be seen as the continuation of a more general interest that developed since the second half of the 13th century for archaizing manuscripts imitating the refined book production of the 10th and 11th century. As to Byzantium, this trend is exemplified by the miniatures of King David in Ms. Gr. 269 (St Petersburg, National Library, 13th century, second half) and in Palat. Ms. Gr. 381 [B] (Vatican Library, ca. 1300), as well as by the script and decoration of the manuscripts of the so-called &lsquo;Palaiologina atelier&rsquo;.<br />\r\nThe 11th-century Gospels Paris Gr. 74 (Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale de France) offers the closest known parallel to the frieze images in the evangelic texts of the Bulgarian manuscript. Four miniatures placed at the end of each Gospel are specifically related to authority. They show the abbot of the Studios Monastery, for whom the Paris Gr. 74 was intended, in interaction with an evangelist. In the Bulgarian manuscript, the abbot&rsquo;s figure is replaced by that of Ivan Alexander, transforming thus the Byzantine paradigm of religious authority into a display of political power and divine validation (ff. 86v, 134v, 212v, and 272v). The figure of the abbot was also supplanted by that of the Tsar in the Last Judgment scene on f. 124r. In so doing, the Bulgarian manuscript offered the sole depiction of a living ruler in Paradise as far as Byzantine art is concerned. In general, emperors form a distinctive group of praying figures at the foot of Christ&rsquo;s throne or on the side of the sinners within the image of the Last Judgment.<br />\r\nThe opening bi-folio family portrait featuring Ivan Alexander&rsquo;s second wife, offspring and son-in-law, adheres to another tradition of Byzantine imagery related to dynastic portraiture as exemplified by the miniature of the Empress Eudocia and her two sons on f. Br in the Paris Gregory (Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale de France, gr. 510, 879-883) and that on f. 5r in the Barberini Psalter (Vatican, Barb. gr. 372, 11th century). The most noticeable difference is the inclusion of Ivan Alexander&rsquo;s daughters. Usually, only male heirs accompany the image of the ruler.<br />\r\nThe legacy of the Bulgarian Gospels manuscript north of the Danube River has been associated with three Wallachian and Moldavian codices so far: the Gospels Canonici Gr. 122 (Oxford, Bodleian Library, 1429), M 694 (New York, Morgan Library, 1492), and Su&ccedil;evi\u0163a 23 (Su&ccedil;evi\u0163a Monastery, 1568-1577). All three were produced for members of the ruling family in local workshops and contributed in enriching further the visual legacy of the wider Byzantine world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Digitized Manuscripts</strong><br />\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=add_ms_39627_fs001r\">Add.

    "text":"<p><em>By&nbsp;&Ouml;zlem Eren</em>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<em>University of Wisconsin-Madison</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nSt. Demetrios Cathedral in Vladimir was built by Vsevolod III the &ldquo;Big Nest&rdquo; (<em>\u0412\u0441\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434 III \u042e\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 &laquo;\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u0413\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043e&raquo;</em>, r. 1177&ndash;1212) between 1193 and 1197. It is a massive cube-shaped building with a cupola on a long drum. The height of the church is approximately equal to its width and the length (approx. 15m) excluding the drum, but the decorative elements on the wall surfaces provide a visual elongation of the proportions. The walls are made of white limestone. It has a typical Middle Byzantine cross-in-square plan with a dome, but the thick, sturdy appearance of the building, the rounded portals, and the exterior decoration with stone reliefs, blind arcades, and corbels with figural sculptures give the impression of a Western Romanesque church. The most interesting feature of the exterior of St. Demetrios is the stone relief decoration displaying fantastic creatures and animals. Such a decorative scheme is uncommon in Eastern Orthodox churches.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe main entrance to the building is located on the west side, and the east side has three protruding cylindrical apses. The fa&ccedil;ades on the three sides of the building are divided into three horizontal tiers of decoration. The bottom tier is without any carved decorations; the middle tier has decorative blind arcades, and the top tier has three semi-circular bays with rounded tops (zakomara) covered with carved stone reliefs. Of the 566 carved reliefs on the three walls of the building, not including the carvings of the blind arcades, only 46 images are drawn from Christian subjects. The rest include floral patterns, birds, lions, leopards, fantastic hybrid creatures, and griffins.<br />\r\nThe original appearance of the church was different. Externally it was surrounded on three sides by covered galleries; and additionally, towers on the west side provided access to the interior &lsquo;princely&rsquo; galleries. St. Demetrios Cathedral was included on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nVladimir is an ancient town established in the 12th century on the <em>zalessky kray </em>(<em>\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439</em>, &ldquo;the land beyond the forest&rdquo;) north-east of the state of Kyivan Rus, or today&rsquo;s Golden Ring region, on the Kliazma River that linked it with the Volga River&mdash;the old trading route of Eastern Europe. Vladimir-Suzdal Principality reached its Golden Age under the Grand Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky (r. 1157&ndash;74). St. Demetrios Cathedral was built by Prince Andrei&rsquo;s half-brother, Vsevolod III, beginning in 1193.<br />\r\nThe monumental architecture of the principality of Vladimir-Suzdal has unique characteristics that distinguish it from Kyiv. First, the building material is predominantly white-stone, not brick or opus-mixtum. Between the reign of Yury Dolgoruky and the Mongol invasion by Batu Khan (1238), 22 white-stone buildings were erected. Second, the church fa&ccedil;ades display sculptural reliefs of animal and human figures, which is unusual in Eastern Orthodox church architecture. &nbsp;<br />\r\nThe outside appearance of St. Demetrios Cathedral is in continuation with the earlier white stone churches of Vladimir built by Andrei Bogolyubsky ca.1158&ndash;1160. On all three fa&ccedil;ades, the central zakomara displays a figure of the Biblical hero, King David, who is a model of kingship. King David killed the giant, Goliath, and later established Jerusalem as the capital city, which resonates with the grand princes of the newly established Vladimir-Suzdal Principality. On the left bay of the north fa&ccedil;ade, the patron Vsevolod III is depicted enthroned with his five sons, one in his lap and four others arranged on the right and left. On the south fa&ccedil;ade, Alexander the Great is depicted with two griffins, one to either side. Thus, the visual language of power is apparent in the figural relief decorations on the exterior of the building.<br />\r\nIn the interior, beneath the vaults of the west end &ldquo;princely&rdquo; gallery, fragments of the original 12th-century frescoes were discovered under the layers of paint in 1918. A common theme among these frescoes is the Last Judgment and the separation of the righteous from the damned. On the larger vault beneath the princely gallery, on both slopes, two scenes with rows of saints with open books and angels are depicted. On the smaller vault under the same gallery, a scene of St. Peter leading the righteous wives to heaven, two of whom in the attire of Byzantine princesses, is painted. Another noteworthy scene is where Abraham, holding a soul on his bosom, surrounded by Jacob and Isaac, is placed outside of an enclosed space on the left, where the Mother of God is depicted with angels.&nbsp; This&nbsp;suggests that the Bosom of Abraham is a distinct place from heaven in Eastern Orthodoxy. The fragments of frescoes reveal the adherence to typical Byzantine style and iconography of apostles and saints, with some reminiscence to the frescoes in St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv. This implies a continuity with the Middle Byzantine principles of church interior decoration since the foundation of St. Sophia of Kyiv (1037).<br />\r\nWhen the Rus princes came to <em>zalessky kray</em>, these territories were not unoccupied, as evident from the remainders of pagan names in the region, such as &ldquo;Yarilo&rsquo;s Valley.&rdquo; There were settlements along the west bank of the Volga by Finno-Ugric and Slavonic tribes from the 9th&ndash;10th centuries. The presence of multi-ethnic populations and persistence of pagan along with Christian beliefs (<em>\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0435</em>, &ldquo;dual-faith&rdquo;) among the Slavs, even after the conversion to Christianity (988), complicate the interpretation of the relief decorations of St. Demetrios. The Slavic pagan Zbruch idol (on display at the Krakow Archaeological Museum) in the context of a multi-ethnic environment can help shed light on the dual pagan and Christian symbolism.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe sculptural decoration with lions, griffins, eagles, and vegetal motifs in the architecture of the near-contemporary Serbian monasteries (e.g. Mother of God Church in the Studenica Monastery in Serbia, established by Stefan Nemanja in 1196) display similarities with this already rare decorative style in Medieval Rus. Studenica Monastery has a composite architectural style that brings together the Byzantine, Slavic, and Lombardian (Romanesque) church building and decorating traditions, known as the Ra&scaron;ka School. Architectural similarities between Studenica and St. Demetrios suggest the operation of highly qualified and sophisticated workshops with connections from the Balkans to the regions of Rus. This is in agreement with the cultural unification of Slavs through the formation of a common Slavic language after the introduction of Cyrillic script. Bulgaria and Serbia emerged as the main routes of transmitting the Byzantine culture into Slavic lands in the Balkans and the Rus as the direct ties with the Byzantine Empire weakened over centuries. The artistic activities and the translation efforts of Byzantine texts into Slavonic in various workshops and cultural centers in the Balkans, mainly Preslav, Pliska, and Ohrid, contributed to the selective adoption of Byzantine culture, hence the formation of a unique Slavic Christian identity.<br />\r\nThe most frequently noted aspect of the exteriors of the churches in the area of Vladimir-Suzdal and the Serbian monasteries is their similarities to the 11th-12th-century Romanesque architecture in Italy. However, the commonly featured figures such as lions and griffins are part of an Ancient Persian and Sassanian visual vocabulary &ndash; long before the connection with the Lombard architects was established. The decorative elements have long been transmitted across cultures through small objects traded along the routes connected by Volga. Moreover, Georgian and Armenian churches from the 10th century were predominantly made of stone and displayed similar sculptural relief decorations on their exterior walls (e.g. Church of Holy Cross in Akthamar in today&rsquo;s Van in eastern Turkey.)<br />\r\nTherefore, the methodology of examining these buildings has to go beyond identifying the prototype of each distinct feature.

In the year 7179 [1671].<br />\r\nAfter being presented to the monastery, the <em>kivotion</em> was part of the monastic heritage until World War I, but it bears an adventurous story. First, in 1749, it was given to a certain Milco from Craiova as collateral for an amount of silver borrowed by the monks. After some time, it was redeemed, but was to be hidden in order to be preserved from an uprising burst in 1788. Since then, it remained hidden for a long time, as another monastery nearby was vandalized. By the middle of the 19th century, Tismana Monastery underwent major renovations and a part of the monastic treasury was moved to Hurezy Monastery, where it remained until 1857. Finally, in 1916, the <em>kivotion</em> was sent to Russia as part of the so-called &ldquo;Romanian Treasure,&rdquo; and was returned back to Bucharest only in 1956, together with the second group of artworks returned by the Soviet government, eventually entering the collections of the National Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nA <em>kivotion</em> is a special receptacle in which the reserved Sacrament (a fragment of the consecrated Eucharistic bread on which a drop of consecrated wine is poured) is kept on the altar table for the communion of the sick outside of the Mass, and during Lent serves the purpose of containing the Presanctified gifts. Still nowadays, many Eucharistic containers used in the Christian Orthodox world have an architectural shape or architectural decorative elements, but not all of them reproduce the shape of the church to which they belonged. When they do, this was usually intended to support and reinforce the connection between the donor and the monastic or ecclesiastical foundation, especially when the donor belonged to the ecclesiastical or political &eacute;lite and was both the donor of the architectural <em>kivotion</em> and the founder or the protector of the monastery. The&nbsp;need to reinforce that connection seems to have been a priority especially in troubled times, when the religious identity and political equilibrium were under threat, and the lay or religious &eacute;lite established themselves as protectors of the Orthodox confessional identity.<br />\r\nThe significance of this object &ndash; definitely not the most precious or magnificent among the <em>kivotia</em> exhibited in the National Museum of Art &ndash; lies in its shape and decoration, specially intended to establish a connection between the <em>kivotion</em> and the <em>katholikon </em>of Tismana Monastery. Its shape seems to reproduce the original structure of the monastery&rsquo;s main church, a triconch with domed towers aligned with the altar, naos, pronaos, and narthex. This structural correspondence between the church and the <em>kivotion</em> was evident and acknowledged at least until the beginning of the 19th century, as testified by the description of this object in a monastic inventory dated 1809 (National Romanian Archives): all this was, of course, lost after the mid-19th century major renovation of the monastery, led by the architect Carol Benesch. To some extent, the <em>kivotion</em> can be considered as a primary source attesting to the appearance of the church in the 17th century: in particular, the <em>kivotion</em>&rsquo;s narthex with a sloping roof and a tower reproduces quite accurately the church fa&ccedil;ade before its renovation, as testified by the comparison with other representations of the monastery in votive paintings and in an early 18th-century drawing. Most appropriately, it can be compared with two representations of the monastery on the reliquary of St. Nicodim&rsquo;s finger &ndash; now at the National Museum of Art (Bucharest) &ndash; that was probably made by the same two Bulgarian goldsmiths Marco and Iacov. The body of the reliquary displays episodes from the saint&rsquo;s life, from birth to death, including his miracles and the foundation of the monastery, that is represented in great detail on the short side of the reliquary box, accompanied by the inscription &laquo;&Sigma;\u0444(\u044a)\u043d\u0442\u0443\u043b \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u044c \u0444\u044a\u043a\u043e\u0443\u0442(-\u0430\u0443) \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0463\u0440\u0438\u043a(\u0430) \u043f\u0440\u0435 \u0422\u0438\u0441(\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430) \u0448\u0438 \u043d\u0443\u043c\u0438 \u0422\u0438\u0441\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430&raquo; / &ldquo;St. Nicodim made a church at Tismana and called it Tismana.&rdquo;<br />\r\nIn the niches on the <em>kivotion</em>, namely between the naos and the altar, two registers saintly figures shown full-length appear and are identified by Cyrillic inscriptions. On the sides of the pronaos and narthex, three episodes from the Life of the Virgin Mary take up the whole space. Biblical figures, floral elements, and cherubic heads fill the empty spaces above the arches. On the side corresponding to the western facade of the building, the episode of the Dormition of the Virgin Mary (Koimesis) is shown &ndash; recalling the dedication of the monastic church &ndash; alongside figures of St. Nicodim and a monk, possibly the hegumen Petronie, the purchaser of the <em>kivotion</em>. On the apse, the two rows of saintly figures are interrupted by a representation of Christ Pantokrator on top and a depiction of the Lamb of God on the bottom: the latter, with the infant Christ lying on the diskos (melismos), follows an iconography that, in different areas of the Balkans, is sometimes painted on the interior decoration of churches, on the apse of the altar. In the Carpathian regions, it appears also as part of the exterior decorative program of churches in the direction of the altar. Its representation on the Tismana <em>kivotion</em> undoubtedly emphasizes its function, adding a further connection between the church where the Eucharistic rite is celebrated and its miniaturized representation containing a fragment of the Eucharist. Although a connection between the<em> kivotion</em>&rsquo;s exterior decoration and the original church interior decoration can be envisaged, it cannot be demonstrated, as unfortunately the original frescoes of the naos and bema were covered in 1732.<br />\r\nThe goldsmiths certainly show talent and experience in the design and execution of this object: the figures are depicted with great mastery, and on the whole, the work is extremely harmonious. In the scenes of the Life of the Virgin Mary, the complex architectural perspective and the dynamism of the characters are evident. Goldsmiths from Chiprovtsi were well-known for their skills and were highly appreciated in Wallachia, where they were welcomed to work after the suppression of the anti-Ottoman Uprising in 1688.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\nDumitrescu, Sorin. <em>The Ecumenical Tabernacles of Petru Rares\u0326 Voivode and Their Celestial Model: An Artistic Investigation of the Churches-Tabernacles from Northern Moldavia.</em>&nbsp;Edited by&nbsp;M.

Its founder, the Serbian archbishop Daniel (Danilo) the Second (1324&ndash;37), built it in the old church site, in the region of Hvostno, on the metochion of \u017di\u010da monastery, next to the church built by the second Serbian archbishop, Arsenios the First (1233/4&ndash;63). In addition to this church, archbishop Daniel erected several other churches and buildings within the monastic complex: the narthex of Pe\u0107, which connects three churches, the small church of St. Nicholas on the south side of the Hodegetria church, and the unpreserved pyrgos dedicated to St. Symeon the Stylite. The church was built around 1330 and painted with frescoes between 1335 and 1337. It was built as the funerary church of the Serbian archbishop Daniel the Second and as the spiritual center of the Greek monks. Since 2006, the church and the whole complex within the monastic walls, including the Churches of Holy Apostles, St. Demetrios, St. Nicholas, the narthex of Pe\u0107, are part of the &ldquo;Medieval Monuments in Kosovo&rdquo;, a combined World Heritage Site with three other monuments of the Serbian Orthodox Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nAs an important part of the Serbian cultural heritage in Kosovo and Metohija, as an endowment of one of the Serbian archbishops and the most learned person among Serbs in the Middle Ages, the church of the Mother of God Hodegetria&rsquo;s significance is manifold: historical, artistic, ecclesiastic, and spiritual. It is a shrine whose building, with the exception of the painted decoration of the fa&ccedil;ades, has preserved its original appearance and whose original frescoes, an iconographic program imbued with numerous and multiple nuanced theological messages and allusions, are almost completely preserved.<br />\r\nThe endowment of Serbian archbishop Daniel the Second has a very rare and double dedication, created under strong Constantinopolitan influence. According to the unknown biographer of Daniel the Second, the church is dedicated to the Mother of God &ldquo;of Constantinople,&rdquo;&nbsp;the feast of the Dormition.<br />\r\nFrom an architectural perspective, the church is unique. Its exterior, dimensions, and features are harmoniously merged into a single architectural corpus of several buildings forming one whole. The specific position of the Church of the Mother of God as a counterpart to the Church of St. Demetrios reveals its two fa&ccedil;ades &ndash; the east one and the south one, which are highlighted by windows, painted ornaments, and niches. The external articulation of the Hodegetria Church entirely corresponds to its internal structure.<br />\r\nThe church has a complex and elaborate structure, conditioned by its multifunctional purpose. The tripartite altar area includes two smaller separate chapels on the site of the <em>prothesis </em>and the <em>diakonikon </em>dedicated to St. Arsenios of Serbia and St. John the Forerunner.<br />\r\nBuilt out of stone and brick and subsequently plastered, the church is of medium size. It has the plan of an inscribed cross with nine bays and painted fa&ccedil;ades, whose preserved frescoes are now rather damaged, and except for non-figural decoration, unidentified. In the first decade of the 21st century, the fa&ccedil;ades were painted red in accordance with its earlier appearance and with decorations added according to the field documentation of \u0110ur\u0111e Bo&scaron;kovi\u0107.<br />\r\nThe church is well lit &ndash; it has three portals and twelve windows. The floor in the church is composed of multicolored stone slabs of large dimensions. In front of the northeast column, there is a coffin-reliquary with the holy remains of the Serbian archbishop Sabbas the Third (1309&ndash;16), while on the opposite side in front of the southeast column is a representatively carved throne, with the miraculous icon of the Mother of God of Pe\u0107 Krasnica of a later date, made in the 19th century. Particularly notable in the northwest bay of the church is the tombstone of the founder of the Church of the Mother of God in the form of a sarcophagus made of reddish Rugova marble.<br />\r\nFrom a decorative perspective, the Church of the Mother of God in Pe\u0107 represents one of the rich and conceptually layered program ensembles of wall painting in the Serbian medieval state. All frescoes belong to the older layer, the one from around 1335&ndash;37, except for the representation of the church donor with St. Nicholas of Myra and the fresco of St. Ermolai, most probably dated to the fifth decade of the 14th century.<br />\r\nThe painted program of the Church of the Mother of God was outlined in such a way that the separate church units constitute a thematically well-rounded whole, both enriching and complementing the themes of the wall painting of the church. All inscriptions are written in Serbo-slavonic, except for the one on the codex of prophet Habaccuc in the sanctuary (written in Greek).<br />\r\nDepicted in the calotte of the dome of the Mother of God Hodegetria in Pe\u0107 is the bust of Christ Pantokrator, surrounded by the text of Psalm 101 and the scene of the Heavenly Liturgy, while below, in the drum the figures of the prophets are surmounted by cherubs. In the pendentives there are figures of evangelists, while between the pendentives of the north and south sides are cherubs with scrolls handed to the evangelists.<br />\r\nThe wall painting of the Church of the Mother of God comprises three cycles (the cycle of the Great Feasts, the Post-Resurrection cycle and the cycles of the patron saint), that of the chapel of St. Arsenios of Serbia depicts the cycle of the life of St. Arsenios, while the chapel of St. John the Forerunner portrays the cycle of St. John the Forerunner; different categories of saints are represented as individual figures, mainly in the register of standing figures in all three ensembles. On the south wall of the church the procession of the holy monks is depicted while across from them, on the north wall, is the procession of the holy warriors.<br />\r\nThe dado register, regularly designed in the form of geometric fields inscribed in a square, also contains an unusual iconographic solution &ndash; on the north wall, there is an ochre field with representations of monochrome snakes, shown next to one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\n\u0110uri\u0107, Vojislav, ed.&nbsp; <em>Arhiepiskop Danilo II i njegovo doba: me\u0111unarodni nau\u010dni skup povodom 650 godina od smrti: decembar 1987.&nbsp;</em>Beograd: SANU, 1991.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This collection of papers contains articles written by different specialized scholars analyzing various topics related to the Church of the Mother of God (architecture, dedication of the church, the iconographic program of the frescoes, the tomb of archbishop Daniel the Second, liturgical themes in the fresco program, figures of prophets, etc.).</p><p>\u0110uri\u0107, Vojislav, Vojislav&nbsp;Kora\u0107, and Sima \u0106irkovi\u0107. <em>Pe\u0107ka patrijar&scaron;ija.</em> Beograd: Jugoslovenska revija, 1990.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">In this monograph the architecture and the wall painting of the church of the Mother of God Hodegetria as part of the monastery complex in Pe\u0107 has been analyzed most minutely up to that moment.

    "text":"<p><em>By Franka Horvat&nbsp;</em>| <em>University of California, Los Angeles</em><br />\r\n<strong>Context</strong><br />\r\nThe church of St. Nicholas on the island of Kolo\u010dep, Croatia is one of the best-preserved Elaphiti churches. This is partially due to the conservation and restoration work undertaken in the late 90s and early 2000, and partially because it was still in use up until the restoration. It served the purpose of a funerary chapel of the island&rsquo;s only cemetery, a function that it acquired &mdash; according to ethnographic data &mdash; in the 19th century when the cemetery was moved to its present location. The prior function of the monument is uncertain. There are no mentions of it in the archival sources, and it is possible that St. Nicholas is not its original dedication. However, its location in the inland of the island, in the midst of the agricultural zone and on the path that connects the two modern settlements can shed light on the medieval use of the church. Clues about the users are also to be found in the monument&rsquo;s architectural forms and decoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nLike most other medieval churches on the Elaphiti Islands, St. Nicholas belongs to the so-called southern-Dalmatian dome type: a regional variant of a simple single-aisle church which can be found all over the Mediterranean. All southern-Dalmatian dome type churches are built out of rough-cut stone and covered by mortar, share the ground plan consisting of a three-bay interior vaulted by a dwarf dome in the middle, and have a similar wall articulation. Such structures are usually dated to the 9th or 10th century, and brought into connection with other pre-Romanesque monuments on the Dalmatian coast. However, architectural features can seldom provide a secure date, since the southern-Dalmatian dome type persisted for generations. The church of St. Nicholas has been dated to the 11th century based on stylistic features and inscriptions on the sculpture found during the conservation campaign. The bell-tower dates to the 16th century.<br />\r\nSometime between the construction of St. Nicholas and the addition of the bell-tower, there was another intervention phase in which the church was painted. Not a great deal of the fresco cycle is preserved. In the apse survives a curious variation of the De&euml;sis in which the Archangel Michael takes the place of the Virgin on the right. While local patron saints can step in for John the Baptist in rural areas, the replacement of the Virgin is unprecedented in three-figure De&euml;sis compositions. The Archangel Michael appears once more in the central bay beneath the dome, facing his counterpart, the Archangel Gabriel, who is painted in the same position on the opposite wall. The same regard to symmetry is evident in other surviving figures, preserved in the upper registers of the north and the south wall. &nbsp;They have been identified by previous scholarship as Saints Peter and Paul, and Maurus and Stephen. The figure of Saint George, portrayed beneath the Archangel Michael, has lost his pair. There is not a single narrative scene in the church: the cycle is dominated by devotional images and non-iconic representations. All of these factors indicate that the church should be brought into connection with laymen and laywomen, rather than with a monastic community. A closer look into hagiographic aspects will shed additional light on the devotional practices on the island.<br />\r\nOrnament does not serve only as filler, but covers, or it used to cover, the entire surface of both barrel vaults of the church. This motif, which loosely resembles a series of hour-glasses, can be found in churches of Serbia, as well as several regions of Greece (namely Macedonia, Mani, and Crete), but nowhere is it given such a prominent position as in St. Nicholas. The replication of the motif enables a comparative analysis with other monuments, revealing patterns of transmission.<br />\r\nHowever, the closest parallels to St. Nicholas are found in Calabria, in the church of San Donato al Pantano. Stylistic comparison can be drawn both on the account of chromatic effects, brush strokes, and facial features of the figures, and on the correspondence of particular details, such as for example the pearled halos. While it is hard to date the wall painting of the church of St. Nicholas with precision, comparisons with the cases of San Donato al Pantano, San Biagio in San Vito dei Normanni, and possibly others, point to a date at the end of the 12th or beginning of the 13th century.&nbsp;<br />\r\nAlthough largely unknown in international scholarship, the small archipelago of the Elaphiti Islands, located in the southern Adriatic Sea only a few nautical miles away from Ragusa (medieval Dubrovnik), is remarkably rich in material remains from the Middle Ages. The church of Saint Nicholas is one of the 15 surviving medieval churches on the three inhabited islands of the chain &mdash; Kolo\u010dep, Lopud, and &Scaron;ipan. Apart from the corresponding inventories of the churches, material evidence includes traces of settlements, including secular buildings, cisterns, agricultural facilities, and paved paths. Furthermore, the islands are well attested in 13th-century documents preserved in the Archive of Dubrovnik. These sources offer insight about the islanders&rsquo; occupations, family bonds and relations with neighbors, and thus shed light on the social and economic aspects of the islands.<br />\r\nMoreover, these documents portray the islands as sites where large ships harbored to board cargo, tradesmen conducted business, and artisans recruited their apprentices. A number of archival records show that the islanders, as well as the city-dwellers, engaged in trade relations with other regions of the Mediterranean. This is confirmed by material evidence on the islands, which synthesizes Byzantine, Italianate, and local elements. In other words, not only do the Elaphiti Islands lend themselves well to the study of medieval art on the periphery of various empires, but they also allow for a broader examination of island cultures, island-mainland dynamics, and wider Mediterranean networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nGerstel, Sharon. <em>Rural Lives and Landscapes in Late Byzantium: Art, Archaeology, and Ethnography. </em>New York: Cambridge University Press, 2015.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">A seminal publication on non-urban Byzantium in which the author uses archaeological, ethnographic, pictorial and written sources to uncover the patterns of daily life of villagers in remote areas of rural Greece.

    "text":"<p><strong>Research Project</strong>&nbsp;by Ivan Drpi\u0107, University of Pennsylvania<br />\r\n<strong>Overview</strong><br />\r\nThis project undertakes a systematic study of the materials and techniques of gilding in medieval Serbian painting. The investigation focuses on the pictorial decoration of the churches at Studenica (1208/9), Mile&scaron;eva (shortly before 1227), Sopo\u0107ani (ca. 1265), Gradac (ca. 1280), and Banjska (ca. 1317&ndash;21), all founded by members of the ruling Nemanji\u0107 dynasty. The murals of these churches originally featured backgrounds covered with gold leaf and patterned in imitation of mosaic tesserae&mdash;an expensive and fragile form of decoration only traces of which now survive. Research is conducted through a combination of in situ examination and recording, sampling, and laboratory microanalyses. The project&rsquo;s immediate goal is to generate new data on an unusual and poorly understood form of decoration and thus to contribute to a better understanding of the production and materiality of medieval wall painting. Beyond this, the project situates the Serbian gilded murals with simulated tessellation within the broader context of Mediterranean visual culture in the later Middle Ages. It takes the economy, technology, and aesthetics of gilding as the entry point for an inquiry into Serbia&rsquo;s place in a transcultural network defined by trade, diplomacy, and the traffic of people, goods, and ideas.</p>",

The rejection of certain stereotypes concerning the appearance, spreading, cosmology, ecclesiology, liturgical practice, and social teaching of the aforementioned heresies is related to the edition and analysis of new unknown Greek and Slavic sources.

The team analyzes the ideas of Byzantine authors, as well as Old Russian authors, creatively using the sources created by the former ones. The comparison of the two traditions (the Byzantine and Old Church Slavonic) will help trace the process of the formation of stereotypes and the mechanism of their circulation within Byzantine-Slavic culture. The oldest texts on Islam were created in Rus&rsquo; in the 12th century and the most complete and most diverse come from the 14th&ndash;16th century. It allows tracing the circumstances and reasons for emerging ethnic and religious stereotypes and the process of their transfer, beginning in the early Middle Ages up to the 16th century. The team will make an analysis of the phenomena accompanying the transfer of stereotypes in time and geographical space (i.e. between the inhabitants of the territories of different cultures and languages), with respect to the changes they undergo with time.<br />\r\nThe implementation of this project will bring tangible results:<br />\r\n- a scientific monograph, which will be the first comprehensive elaboration of the issue: Zofia A.

The text of the chronicle will include a comprehensive historical commentary presenting the text on the possible broad background of the history and culture of Rus&rsquo; in the 11th &ndash; 14th century.

The phenomenon will be considered in three categories: culture of existence, social culture, and symbolic culture. The principal aim of the research is to trace the factors that drove the Serbian population out of their former habitats (Kosovo, Rascia) to the lands of the Habsburg Monarchy (territories of the central Danube), and then to the south-western frontier of Russia. Moreover, the project aims to investigate the relationship between the migration and the transformation of Serbian lifestyles, including the changes within the Serbian family model. It will also endeavor to examine the hypothesis of the emergence of a &ldquo;migration habit&rdquo; among eighteenth-century Serbs, which generated their further mobility towards &ldquo;sweet Orthodoxy&rdquo; (Russia). Another important goal of the project is to compare the development of Serbian culture in the Habsburg state and the Romanov monarchy. In this part of the research, we will analyze the Serbian cultural model and its susceptibility to change in two different spaces (Austrian and Russian). In addition, the relationship between Serbian migration in the early modern era and their axiological sphere will be investigated. The project will also include a discussion of the meaning and role of religious symbols as signs for ethnic-confessional identification of Serbs in the examined period.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe main result of the research will be the development of a monograph and scholarly papers, based on the broadest possible range of texts of culture. This will therefore make it possible to disseminate research results in the international scholarly community.</p>",

Our international team of experts in humanities and computation is digitizing the Studenica church for the first time to study its design principles. We are using a cutting-edge experimental approach whereby architecture-driven computational modeling&mdash;specifically, data-based parametric and reverse architectural design&mdash;is utilized to reveal the underlying systemic logic of the architecture. As such, we analyze individual parts of the building and how they are arranged. This new, computer-led approach is needed for the study of medieval structures because we often lack texts that can offer insight into their creation. The spatial models examine the proportions and the tectonics of the church. The parametric research expands on the modeling of the central core of the church and lighting of its dome. The design of the internally scalloped dome is attributed to imperial Byzantine architecture in Constantinople (Istanbul). Our research also aims to test the transfer of architectural knowledge and whether the dome that scoops the light in shafts&mdash;which remains technically a demanding task in modern construction&mdash;points to the applied medieval knowledge of geometry, physics, and optics. This research features the Studenica church as a model for advanced studies of medieval architecture that often lacks textual sources about its creation or training of its architects.</p>",

From a moral or philosophical point of view, luxury is seen as a form of decadence, although from the economic perspective it is seen as a force that drives the development of the consumerist economy. Every society knows it in some form, regardless of the degree of economic development, reserving luxury to elite groups, who show their power and pomp through the display of luxury goods. The history of luxury is, therefore, from this perspective, a history of power, reflecting the syncretism of cultural and political thought. Luxury and fashion as components of material culture can also be analyzed through the lens of cultural history since they play an important role in the creation of visual culture. This project proposes to analyze the Christian elites of Ottoman dominated Europe in the Early Modern period from these perspectives, and to look at how they defined their social status and identity at the intersection of East and West. In such an analysis, the Westernization of South-Eastern Europe proceeds not just through the spread of Enlightenment ideas and the influence of the French Revolution, but also through changes in visual culture brought about by Western influence on notions of luxury and fashion. This approach allows a closer appreciation of the synchronicities and time lags between traditional culture, developments in political thought, and social change in the context of the modernization or &ldquo;Europeanization&rdquo; of this part of Europe.<br />\r\n<strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nVintil\u0103-Ghi\u021bulescu, Constan\u021ba. <em><a href=\"http://humanitas.ro/humanitas/carte/tinere%C8%9Bile-unui-ciocoia%C8%99\"><strong>Via\u021ba lui Dimitrie Foti Meri\u0219escu de la Colentina scris\u0103 de el &icirc;nsu\u0219i la 1817</strong></a> </em>[A braggart&#39;s boyhood: the life of Dimitrie Foti Meri\u0219escu of Colentina, written by himself].

    "text":"<p><em>By Ovidiu Cristea |&nbsp;Institute of History &bdquo;Nicolae Iorga&rdquo;, Bucharest</em><br />\r\n<strong>Historical Overview</strong><br />\r\nPresent Romania includes four major historical provinces: Transylvania, Wallachia, Moldavia, and Dobroudja. Transylvania was the west-central part of the territory and it is bordered on the south and on the east by the Carpathian Mountains. Historical Moldavia (a territory shared today by Romania and the Republic of Moldova) included the region between the Carpathian Mountains and Dniestr, while Wallachia was situated between the Danube (to the south) and the Carpathian Mountains (to the north). Doubroudja was the territory bordered on the west and north by the Danube and on the east by the Black Sea. For a short period, this province became a part of Wallachia especially during the reign of Mircea the Elder (r. 1386&ndash;1418) but most of its history is related to other political entities (Byzantine Empire, Bulgarian Kingdom, Ottoman Empire).<br />\r\nEach province had its own historical evolution. Starting with the reign of King Stephen I (1001&ndash;38), Transylvania was progressively conquered by the Hungarian Kingdom, a process that ended in the 13th century. Thus, Transylvania was a part of medieval Hungary, which nevertheless preserved a certain identity. The rulers of Transylvania, called a <em>voivode</em> (as the Wallachian and Moldavian rulers) was appointed by the Hungarian king. Some of them played, however, major political roles. This was the case, for example, with Ladislau Kan (1296&ndash;1315) who was involved in the struggles for the Hungarian throne at the beginning of the 14th century; Stibor of Stiboricz (r. 1395&ndash;1401; 1410&ndash;14), one of the main military commanders of the King Sigismund of Luxemburg (r. 1387&ndash;1437); and especially John Hunyadi, a leader of the Later Crusade who after the crusade of Varna (1444) became governor of the Hungarian Kingdom. The reign of King Sigismund of Luxemburg marked a turning point in the evolution of Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia. Confronted with the Ottoman expansion, the King intended to transform the aforementioned realms into sort of outposts aimed to halt the Ottoman advance. John Hunyadi pursued the same policy. Later on, the most important figure of medieval Moldavia, Stephen III &ldquo;the Great&rdquo; (r. 1457&ndash;1504) adapted this strategy trying to create a system of alliances between Moldavia, Transylvania, and Wallachia.<br />\r\nWallachia and Moldavia emerged much later, in the 14th century, on the political stage of South-Eastern Europe. For a long period, their territories were controlled by Turkic Nomads (Petchenegues, Cumans) and later, after the Mongol invasion of 1241&ndash;42 by the Khanate of the Golden Horde. The emergence of Wallachia was the result of a twofold process: the decline of the Golden Horde and a military offensive of the Hungarian Kingdom beyond the Carpathians. Originally a vassal state of Hungary, Wallachia broke its allegiance in 1330 during the reign of Basarab I (r. 1310&ndash;42), after a successful war against Hungary. Until the mid-15th century Wallachian history balanced between tense relations with Hungary and peaceful periods when the Wallachian lords acknowledged the Hungarian king&rsquo;s suzerainty. From 1359 onward, the Wallachian Church was led by an Orthodox metropolitan appointed by the Patriarchy of Constantinople. The reign of Mircea the Elder (r. 1386&ndash;1418) corresponded with the apogee of Wallachia, the voivode playing an important role in the fight against the Ottoman Empire being also involved, after 1402, in the struggle for the succession to the Ottoman throne between the sons of Sultan Bayezid I (r. 1389&ndash;1402).<br />\r\nMoldavia followed a similar evolution; initially, it was a border province of the Hungarian Kingdom to the east of Carpathians, a military outpost against the Golden Horde. During the reign of Bogdan I (r. 1363&ndash;67), the province overthrew the Hungarian suzerainty and oriented its foreign policy towards the Kingdom of Poland. In 1387, this political option was sealed by a special ceremony that took place in Lviv. The Moldavian ruler, Peter I (r. 1386&ndash;92) swore an oath as a vassal of the Polish King, Vladislas Jagiello. From that moment onward, Moldavia was a vassal state of the Polish Kingdom, a situation never accepted by the Hungarian Kingdom. Some Moldavian rulers used skillfully this Polish-Hungarian rivalry in their quest to strengthen their position along the eastern borders of the Carpathians. Like Wallachia, Moldavia was a part of the Orthodox cultural sphere. A Long conflict with the Patriarchy of Constantinople, settled only at the beginning of the 15th century, conferred a certain degree of autonomy to the Moldavian Church relative to the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The reign of Stephen III (r. 1457&ndash;1504) corresponded with the political, military, and cultural apogee of the Moldavian medieval state. He pursued an active and aggressive policy in the region in a political context dominated by the Ottoman expansion and by the reign of some key figures as Sultan Mehmed II, King of Hungary, Mathias Corvinus, and the Polish King, Cazimir IV. Due to his military successes, he managed to preserve and strengthen his position becoming one of the most important political actors of the region. He was also the founder of many monasteries and churches across Moldavia and was one of the most important donors of Mount Athos in the period after the fall of Constantinople in 1453.<br />\r\nThe 16th century brought a significant change in the history of all three main Romanian provinces after the Hungarian defeat at Mohacs (1526) and the transformation of an important part of the Hungarian land in an Ottoman province (1541). Transylvania preserved its autonomy but became a tributary of the Ottoman Empire, a step already undertaken by Wallachia and Moldavia in the 15th century (Moldavia rebelled against the Ottoman Empire in 1473 but resumed its status towards the end of Stephen III&rsquo;s reign). As their room for maneuvers diminished considerably, many projects of the period emphasized the idea of a political and military collaboration between Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia aimed to contain the Ottoman power. The idea was put into practice for a short time by the Wallachian prince, Michael the Brave (r. 1593-1601). Michael conquered Transylvania and Moldavia (1600&ndash;01) during the &ldquo;Long Turkish War&rdquo; (1593&ndash;1606), which opposed the Habsburgs and the Ottomans. Although Michael&rsquo;s political project was short-lived, it was pursued in the 17th century by several Transylvanian princes.<br />\r\nAll in all, the 16th and the 17th centuries corresponded with a period of undisputed Ottoman hegemony over the three Romanian principalities. Their political and military importance decayed, with only Transylvania preserving a certain degree of autonomy. The political decline of the period is, however, compensated by developments in the cultural sphere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates </strong><br />\r\nThere are many debates concerning Romanian medieval history. For example, the issue of the Romanian continuity after the retreat of the Roman army and administration (271&ndash;275) was for a long period a bone of contention in Romanian and Hungarian historiography. For the 13th-17th centuries, one of the key topics of communist historiography concerned the national character of the three principalities and the so-called &bdquo;Romanian medieval unity.&rdquo; Many historians of the communist period tried to argue that, despite their political separation, Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia shared common ideals and followed, generally, the same political goals. Even those scholars that acknowledged that Transylvania was a part of the Kingdom of Hungary and was ruled by a Hungarian and Saxon elite claimed that, at least in the case of Wallachia and Moldavia, there are solid arguments in support of the idea of common interests. The fact that both provinces shared a common language, faith, and institutions were considered major arguments in support of the idea of a medieval virtual union of the Romanians. According to this view, the ideal reached its apex during the reign of Michael the Brave in Wallachia who, for a short time, managed to control all three historical realms.<br />\r\nPresent historiography shares a more balanced view, insisting on the particular context in which the three provinces evolved. Moments of collaboration existed but they were imposed by mere necessities, not by an inchoate national sentiment. There is also an emphasis on the rivalry between the principalities, especially between Wallachia and Moldavia - each realm pretending a sort of pre-eminence in respect with the other. A good example is the reign of Stephen III of Moldavia. Considered by many historians as a sort of champion of Romanian medieval unity due to his repeated attempts to impose his own candidate on the Wallachian throne, Stephen&rsquo;s was perceived by the Wallachian elite as an archenemy. The voivodes appointed by him were forced to abandon their throne or to change their allegiance. Eventually, Wallachia rejected not only Stephen&rsquo;s involvement in its internal affairs but also efforts to be a part of the anti-Ottoman policy pursued by the Moldavian leader.<br />\r\nIn the last decades, Romanian medieval historiography acknowledged an important change of paradigm as many medievalists became more and more interested in topics ignored and less studied until 1990. Among them, the new political history seen as a history of power undertook a special development. There is now a large interest in topics centered on political insignia, ceremonials and rituals, discourses and political vocabulary, and representations. There is also a change of perspective on the medieval sources. The new trend insists on the particular circumstances in which each source was created and on the strong link between the context and the characters involved in the creation of the document. In parallel, Romanian historians continue the work of publication of medieval collections started in the 19th century. The main collection is the Documenta Romaniae Historica, gathering the documents issued by medieval chancelleries. There are three different series (A. Moldavia; B. Wallachia, and C. Transylvania) published by research teams from Ia\u0219i, Bucharest, and Cluj-Napoca. Other important collections are Foreign Travellers in Romanian Principalities, which gathers texts about Wallachia, Moldavia, and Transylvania in 14th&ndash;18th c., and the Fontes Historiae Daco-Romanae, which includes fragments of medieval chronicles concerning medieval Romania.<br />\r\nThe study of Romanian medieval history could open many directions of research. Wallachia and Moldavia were a part of &ldquo;the Byzantine commonwealth&rdquo; but received strong influences from neighboring kingdoms (Hungary, Poland) and later on, Russia. Transylvania is also an interesting case due to its mixed ethnical structures and relative autonomy. The relations of the three principalities with the Ottoman Empire are also&nbsp;interesting case studies&nbsp;as each of the realms share a similar goal (the preservation of their autonomy and identity). Finally, examining the textual sources in dialog with the material evidence could yield additional avenues of inquiry into the specificities of local developments among the Romanian principalities, and their networked position in the period between the 13th and 17th centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nBoia, Lucian. <em>History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Maria Alessia Rossi </em>|<em>&nbsp;Princeton University</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nThe church of St. George at Staro Nagori\u010dino is located on the outskirts of Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia. The Serbian King Milutin (r. 1282&ndash;1321) rebuilt St. George in 1312&ndash;13 on the remains of an 11th-century church, as attested by the inscription in Old Church Slavonic carved on the west portal. The plan of the building follows the cross-in-square type with a narthex at the west and five domes over the naos. The frescoes date between 1315 and 1317, at the time of <em>hegoumenos</em> Venjamin, and can be attributed with certainty to the workshop of Michael Astrapas, whose name appears in several instances within the church. The iconographic program of the naos includes the Life of Christ, that of St. George, and standing saints. The Life of the Virgin Mary is depicted in the <em>prothesis</em>, and that of St. Nicholas in the <em>diakonikon</em>. The narthex is covered with scenes from the Menologion, and on the north wall there is a dedicatory portrait of King Milutin with a model of the church, alongside his wife, the Byzantine Princess and Serbian Queen, Simonis (b.1293/4), Sts. Constantine and Helena on the left, and St. George on the right. The original marble iconostasis preserves fresco icons depicting St. George <em>Diassoritis</em> and the Virgin <em>Pelagonitissa</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nKing Milutin&rsquo;s reign was a time of military expansion, wealth, and religious fervor. He was a great military leader and conquered many territories, especially at the expense of the Byzantine Empire. These victories brought new revenues: the silver mines near Novo Brdo made him one of the richest men of his time. The chronicle written by archbishop Danilo II (b. ca. 1270), one of Milutin&rsquo;s closest counsellors, tells us that with this wealth Milutin commissioned more than forty buildings, nearly one for each year of his reign, ranging from churches and palaces to fortresses and hospitals, and stretching from Skopje to Jerusalem, including Constantinople, Thessaloniki and Mount Athos.<br />\r\nAmong these commissions is the church of St. George at Staro Nagori\u010dino. The church of St. George, in fact, is traditionally believed to have been commissioned in the 11th century by the Byzantine Emperor Romanos Diogenes IV (r. 1068&ndash;71). It is not clear how this earlier structure looked like, but the masonry made of carefully cut ashlars is still visible on the exterior, suggesting that the 11th-century church was a rectilinear building with a semicircular apse. Scholarship has unanimously agreed that its restoration and dedication to St. George should be seen in connection to a victory of the Byzantine emperor over the Turks in Asia Minor, thanks to the military contingent sent by Milutin. The architecture of St. George seems to reference contemporary Byzantine models. The cloisonn&eacute; masonry construction and the brickwork of St. George find their closest parallels in the architecture of Epiros.<br />\r\nThe artist, Michael Astrapas, to whom Milutin commissioned the monumental decoration of St. George, was Greek, most probably from Thessaloniki. His signature appears twice in the decoration: once, on the <em>hiton </em>of the holy warrior St. Theodore Teron depicted between the naos and the narthex (&Chi;&Epsilon;&Iota;&Rho; &Mu;&Iota;&Chi;&Alpha;&Eta;&Lambda; &Epsilon;&Upsilon;&Tau;&Upsilon;&Chi;&Iota;&Omicron;&Upsilon;), and a second time, in the inscription on the west wall of the narthex (&Chi;&Epsilon;&Iota;&Rho; &Mu;&Iota;&Chi;&Alpha;&Eta;&Lambda; [&Tau;&Omicron;&Upsilon;] &Zeta;&Omicron;&Gamma;&Rho;&Alpha;&Phi;&Omicron;&Upsilon;). There are no historical records of Michael, but by tracing his signatures, scholars have suggested that he was trained in the church of St. Clement in Ohrid (1294/5) with his father Eutychios, whose signatures are also found in this monument. Michael then moved to the Serbian Kingdom, where he became Milutin&rsquo;s chief painter. Michael&rsquo;s team worked, among other places, in Bogorodica Ljevi&scaron;ka in Prizren (1306/7); the Church of St. Prohor of P\u010dinja near Vranje; the King&rsquo;s church in Studenica (1313/14); St. George at Staro Nagori\u010dino; St. Nikita near \u010cu\u010der (ca.1321); and the monastery of Gra\u010danica (1320&ndash;21).<br />\r\nThe inscriptions in the church are both in Greek and in Old Church Slavonic. The latter was consciously used both for the inscription mentioning Milutin on the exterior of the church and for his donor portrait in the narthex. In addition to the political affiliation implied with the use of one language rather than the other, the choice of local saints and bishops included in the monumental decoration offers a glimpse into the relationship between the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Archbishopric of Ohrid. Sts. Constantine Kabasilas and Clement of Ohrid appear in the scene of the Divine Liturgy in the <em>prothesis</em>. The cult of these saints is also widespread in the Archbishopric of Ohrid, and in fact, they were represented in the church of the Perivleptos, also known as St. Clement, in Ohrid (1295). However, in the latter, they are depicted near the entrance of the <em>prothesis</em> from the naos. This prominent position, in St. George, is occupied by the founder and the first bishop of the Serbian Orthodox Church, St. Sava. It is telling that the inscription identifying Sava is in Greek and includes the exact title that the Patriarchate of Constantinople used for Serbian Orthodox bishops in official documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nDimitrova, Elizabeta, and Sas\u030co Korunovski. <em>Macedonia: l&rsquo;arte medievale dal IX al XIV secolo</em>, 161&ndash;168.

London: Routledge, 2021.<br />\r\nThis book is the first of its kind to provide a point of reference for the history of the whole of Eastern Europe during the Middle Ages. While historians have recognized the importance of integrating the eastern part of the European continent into surveys of the Middle Ages, few have actually paid attention to the region, its specific features, problems of chronology and historiography. This vast region represents more than two-thirds of the European continent, but its history in general&mdash;and its medieval history in particular&mdash;is poorly known. This book covers the history of the whole region, from the Balkans to the Carpathian Basin, and the Bohemian Forest to the Finnish Bay. It provides an overview of the current state of research and a route map for navigating an abundant historiography available in more than ten different languages. Chapters cover topics as diverse as religion, architecture, art, state formation, migration, law, trade and the experiences of women and children. This book is an essential reference for scholars and students of medieval history, as well as those interested in the history of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Table of Contents: </strong><br />Florin Curta, <em>Introduction</em><br />\r\nChristian Raffensperger, <em>Situating medieval Eastern Europe: historiography and discontent </em><br />\r\nDanijel D\u017eino<i>, </i><em>Between migration and </em>origo gentis: <em>population movements</em><br />\r\nEvgenia Komatarova-Balinova, <em>Steppe empires without emperors: Avars, Bulgars and&nbsp;Khazars </em><br />\r\nAleksander Paro\u0144, <em>Medieval nomadism </em><br />\r\nMaddalena Betti,<i> </i><em>Early conversion to Christianity, Judaism and Islam </em><br />\r\nIvo &Scaron;tefan,<i> </i><em>Conversion to Christianization: Bohemia, Poland, Hungary, and Rus&rsquo; (9<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> centuries)</em><br />\r\nDavid Kalhous, <em>State formation in the 10<sup>th</sup> century</em><br />\r\nHajnalka Herold, <em>Strongholds and early medieval states </em><br />\r\nCosmin Popa-Gorjanu, <em>The rise of the early medieval aristocracy </em><br />\r\nDu&scaron;an Zupka, <em>Rulers between ideal and reality</em><br />\r\nAdrien Qu&eacute;ret-Podesta, <em>Royal governments</em><br />\r\nMarek Hlad&iacute;k, <em>Rural economy</em><br />\r\nDariusz Adamczyk, <em>Crafts, coins and trade (900-1300)</em><br />\r\nLauren\u021biu R\u0103dvan, <em>Towns and cities </em><br />\r\nCameron Sutt, <em>Lords, peasants and slaves </em><br />\r\nS&eacute;bastien Rossignol, <em>Women and children </em><br />\r\nBoris Stojkovski, <em>Jews, Armenians and Muslims</em><br />\r\nDariusz Andrzej Sikorski, <em>Church organization </em><br />\r\nPawe\u0142 Figurski and Grzegorz Pac, <em>Saints and relics </em><br />\r\nKiri\u0142 Marinow and Jan Miko\u0142aj&nbsp;Wolski, <em>Heresy and popular religion </em><br />\r\nAleksandar Uzelac, <em>Crusades and Eastern Europe </em><br />\r\nGregory Leighton, <em>The Baltic Crusades (1147-1300)</em><br />\r\nMirjana Matijevi\u0107 Sokol, <em>Political and practical literacy </em><br />\r\nIvan Alexandrov Biliarsky, <em>Law</em><br />\r\nTimofei V.

The bibliography provides comprehensive coverage of all publications, in all languages, pertaining to this vast area of the European continent and its impact on European history from about 500 to the aftermath of the Mongol invasion of 1241. The bibliography aims to encourage further research, but also to provide guidance through an enormous amount of information available in a variety of languages and a great multitude of publications. It offers search capabilities which are particularly useful for very narrowly defined research goals, thus encouraging comparative work with materials from other parts of Europe.

The standardization of its iconographic and technical characteristics has led scholars of post-Byzantine arts to talk of a school of embroidery, the wide popularity of which is evident from remnants in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans. While the uniqueness of its eclectic style primarily leans on Byzantine tradition, the generous incorporation of contemporary Ottoman and Western European elements is equally evident. Then, apart from being an interesting case study of Early Modern artistic melding, this production provides valuable information on the social and cultural conditions of the Greek community as well. Signed mostly by Greek female artisans, as the heads of numerous workshops, these artifacts reveal as much for their patron&rsquo;s taste as for their makers&rsquo; agency. Moreover, the particularity of certain iconographic themes, unique to this school, and their relation to inter-faith dogmatic dialogue between the different Christian denominations gives another insight into the prevalent cultural atmosphere of the period. Essentially, the history of this production is multi-faceted yet very centered: from the marketability of a woman&rsquo;s signature to the refined eclecticism of a well-informed style, all the characteristics of this production brings us in front of a complex cultural setting, in which Greek women embroidered their path to Early Modernity.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe methodology used in this project is interdisciplinary and synthetic, pertaining to the analysis of iconography, style, and technique, the last usually being decisive. In order to attribute the artifacts to their cultural context, we focus on the method of their construction in combination with the study of different factors determining their cultural environment. The outcome of this project is a monograph.</p>",

Between the 13th&nbsp;century and the decades after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the predominantly Orthodox regions of the Balkan Peninsula and the Carpathian Mountains developed at the intersection of different traditions, among them Latin, Greek, Slavic, and Islamic. Yet Byzantium and its cultural legacy and spiritual power offered some of the most influential artistic, literary, religious, and political models to be used and adapted locally. This collection of essays&mdash;covering history, archaeology, literature, art history, architecture, material culture, and theology&mdash;allows for an in depth examination of the visual and cultural production of the Danube regions between local traditions, the Byzantine heritage, and cultural forms adopted from other models, while challenging established perceptions of what constitutes Byzantine and post-Byzantine artistic and cultural production.

    "text":"<p><em>By Emanuela Cernea | National Museum of Art of Romania </em><br />\r\nEnglish translation: Teodor-Cristian Badea<br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe embroidery (187 x 154 cm; 169 x 136 cm), on display in the National Museum of Art of Romania, Bucharest (Inv. no. 15826/B 181), was discovered in 1860 inside Cozia Monastery by archeologist Alexandru Odobescu during the first governmental scientific mission for inventorying the medieval patrimony of the Romanian Principalities. After its discovery, the embroidery was transferred to the National Museum of Antiquities in Bucharest.<br />\r\nThe blue silk used as a chromatic support for the golden thread decoration survives only partially, and it is highly deteriorated. It is possible that pearls or precious stones were originally added to the embroidery, since we are able to distinguish the remains of the threads used to fix them onto the contour of the decorations.<br />\r\nThe embroidery is dated according to the inscription that runs along the border, which, in the bottom left corner, displays the year 6904 / 1396 (<em>Anno Domini</em>). Although in publications from the first half of the 20th century it appears dated as 6930 / 1422, this reading error can be explained by the fact that, for a period of 40 years, the embroidery was unavailable to researchers, being evacuated to Russia along with 39,320 other cultural goods that were part of Romania&#39;s Thesaurus, sheltered there during the First World War (between 1916-17 and 1956). Studies of the piece during this long period of time were only indirectly realized, through older publications or archived images, and thus the last number of the Byzantine date, respectively &Delta;(04), could be misspelled as &Lambda;(30). The error was amended after the year 1956, when the piece was returned to Romania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nSpecialists unanimously consider the Cozia <em>epitaphios</em> to be exemplary in its iconographic scheme, it being the oldest dated <em>epitaphios</em> in which the scene of Christ&#39;s Mourning incorporates historical figures in addition to celestial beings. Its unique iconography brings together, near the catafalque, the angels bearing liturgical fans and candles, performing the sacrament of the Eucharistic sacrifice, as well as two of the historical figures most affected by the earthly drama of Jesus&#39; death: the Virgin Mary and the young Apostle John. This iconographic transition is associated by researchers with the Orthodox liturgical innovations of the Holy Week, which had an immediate artistic effect in the creation of the <em>epitaphios </em>&ndash; a processional veil specifically conceived for these particular rituals.<br />\r\nBecause the moment in which these first <em>epitaphioi </em>appeared cannot be precisely identified, although it can be seen that they take over the form and the iconography of the <em>a&euml;rs</em>, used during the Great Entrance, certain researchers have labeled the oldest <em>epitaphioi</em> as <em>a&euml;rs-epitaphioi </em>and admitted that, for a long time, these had served both liturgical functions, that of <em>a&euml;rs</em> with the symbolic image of the Eucharistic sacrifice - <em>Christ Amnos </em>- and that of <em>epitaphios</em>, by introducing the representation of the Lamentation at the tomb (<em>Threnos</em>). The functionality of the two types of embroidery will be differentiated in time through the attenuation of the symbolic message of the <em>a&euml;rs</em> in favor of the narrative meaning of the <em>epitaphios</em>, which will expand onto the evangelical episode of the Lamentation and Burial of Christ through a multitude of characters, topographical details or props.<br />\r\nIn the context of the Byzantine liturgy renewal, the Cozia <em>epitaphios</em> emphasizes the relationship between the iconographic innovations of this type of liturgical veil and the new Orthodox Church&rsquo;s services of the Holy Week. The inscription embroidered along its edges - <em>Let all mortal flesh be silent </em>&ndash; which reproduces a special prayer uttered only during the new mass of the Holy Saturday is used for the first time on a Byzantine embroidery and could signify the moment of a major shift in the meaning and function of the <em>a&euml;rs</em>. The same prayer will later be found on <em>epitaphios</em> on which the iconography is solely concentrated on the illustration of the historical drama of Christ&rsquo;s death, like on the Bloomington (1535) or the Cotroceni (1680) <em>epitaphioi</em>, both executed in Walachia and most probably using the inscription on the Cozia epitaphios as a model. It is remarkable, nevertheless, that despite all of the iconographical or textual innovations, the Cozia <em>epitaphios </em>is strongly connected to the symbolism of the <em>a&euml;rs</em>. The representation of Christ as the Eucharistic Sacrifice is underlined by the presence of divine ministers and even more so by laying His body on a richly decorated support that cannot be associated with the shroud, nor with the Stone of Unction, instead looking more like an altar table.<br />\r\nAnother important aspect of the Cozia <em>epitaphios </em>is the blue color of the silk support, used exceptionally in the oldest byzantine embroideries known today, such as the famous <em>epitaphios</em> gifted by John Cantacuzino to the Vatopedi Monastery, around the middle of the 14th century. The rarity of the fabric and the imperial symbolism of the blue color allows us to associate this embroidery with a prestigious workshop of the late Byzantine cultural sphere. Its inscription indicates that the piece was dedicated to a South Slavonic speaking liturgical space, like Wallachia, probably being, as the legend goes, a gift offered by Mircea I the Elder (r. 1386-1418) to his new foundation at Cozia Monastery. Even though it was produced in a foreign workshop - a Byzantine or a Serbian one - certain details of the Cozia <em>epitaphios</em> passed on to some Wallachian embroideries produced since the beginning of the 16th century, which suggests its presence in Wallachia just after its creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Inscription(s) </strong><br />\r\nSlavonic inscription, along the border: &quot;Let all mortal flesh be silent and stand in fear and trembling, for the King of kings and Lord of lords Christ our God comes to be slaughtered and given as food to the faithful. Before Him go the choirs of angels with all the principalities and powers, the cherubim with many eyes, and the six-winged seraphim covering their faces and crying the hymn Holy Holy Holy.

    "text":"<p><em>By Sne\u017eana Filipova | University of Sts. Cyril and Methodius, Skopje</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe icon of the Virgin Mary and Christ Child from the Holy Virgin Peribleptos Church is now preserved in the Ohrid Gallery of Icons&nbsp;(inv. no. 81). Measuring&nbsp;92 x 53 cm, and executed in&nbsp;tempera on&nbsp;plaster ground on canvas overlaid on board, it displays revetments made of gilded silver. It is among the three examples of a mixed Byzantine-Western style of icons preserved in the Ohrid collection. The second icon is that of St. Nicholas from St. Nikolas Gerakomia Church, and the third example is the Virgin <em>Psychosostria</em>, originally part of the Peribleptos Church iconostasis. The latter dates to the early 14th century, and displays&nbsp;two small angels flanking the Virgin&rsquo;s head, painted in the same technique (tempera, plaster ground on canvas overlaid on board). Since the style of the angels is slightly different, and their colors lighter, Jelena Macan has proposed that the angels are either painted later by the same or another&nbsp;artist. It has been proposed that the painting&nbsp;could have come from Crete.<br />\r\nThe silver gilded revetment is decorated with many repetitive casted curvilinear branches enclosing smaller&nbsp;leaves, large&nbsp;flowers, and circles enclosing a star or eight-sided&nbsp;geometric flowers. In the Mother of God&#39;s aureole, there are three symbols of the evangelists: Matthew (angel) and John (eagle), while instead of the symbols of Luke (calf) and Mark (lion), there is a two-headed eagle with the names of these two evangelists. On the left and right of the Virgin Mary&rsquo;s head, the&nbsp;inscription reads: M(&Eta;&Tau;&Eta;)&Rho; &Theta;(&Epsilon;&Omicron;)&Upsilon;, carried out in two medallions while Christ&#39;s inscription: &Iota;(&Epsilon;\u03f9&Omicron;&Upsilon;)\u03f9 &Chi;(&Rho;&Iota;\u03f9&Tau;&Omicron;)\u03f9 is in his aureole. Besides the floral and geometric decorations on the frame of the icon, there are five standing figures of prophets, turned toward the central duo. On the revetment, the inscription reveals that the donor (possibly of the revetment?) was Archbishop Nicholas (r. 1342&nbsp;or 1346&ndash;56). He attended the coronation of Tsar Du&scaron;an in Skopje and may have ordered the revetment.<br />\r\nI argue that the icon should be dated to&nbsp;1343&ndash;44. The painting style is realistic and the colors used are fresh. The skin is modeled in ochre with greenish and yellowish shades, red on the cheeks, white on the prominent parts. The modeling of the faces is gradual, imitation&nbsp;of natural skin tones. The Virgin Mary is presented as a young woman, half-length, and with the infant Christ on her left arm. She is&nbsp;wearing a red <em>maphorion</em>, hemmed with a yellow stripe, and underneath, a blue kerchief. Christ&rsquo;s hair is reddish-brown, he wears a western-inspired&nbsp;shirt, a grayish-white chiton with a red belt, and an orange cloak. He holds a scroll in his left hand and extends&nbsp;a blessing gesture with his&nbsp;right hand.&nbsp;There are no stars on the Virgin&rsquo;s veil that drapes on her head, shoulders, and sleeves, nor golden lines throughout the cloths. The most unusual detail is Christ&rsquo;s side glance, beyond the picture plane. The position of the Virgin Mary&rsquo;s hands is typical of the work of Italian painters of the late 13th and 14th centuries. The Virgin&rsquo;s right hand is half bent while&nbsp;holding Christ&rsquo;s left foot. This is&nbsp;a very rare feature,&nbsp;found in only two other occurrences: in the fresco icon on the iconostasis of St. George at Staro Nagori\u010dino (1313), and in the apse of the church of the Holy Mother of God in Zaum (1361). The position and form of the Virgin Mary&rsquo;s left hand and the lower part of Christ&rsquo;s body with the golden <em>himation</em> resemble closely the fresco icon from Nagori\u010dino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe oldest photo of the icon once standing on the iconostasis of the&nbsp;Peribleptos Church in Ohrid dates to 1909, and was taken by N. P. Kondakov. This is an exceptional work since there are no other icons that display Gothic elements and Italian&nbsp;painting techniques in&nbsp;the whole collection of medieval icons in Macedonia. Kondakov names it the Virgin of the Passion and compares it to a famous Moscovite monastic&nbsp;icon. Yet, there are no angels with the symbols of Christ&#39;s suffering flanking the Virgin and Child, so it is not an appropriate identification. Moreover, the analogies are not so striking, especially the colors and the drawing, apart from the technique.<br />\r\nBy looking at comparative and contemporary paintings, it would be possible to hypothesize and put forth analogies between the holy duo and the&nbsp;young King Uro&scaron; (1355&ndash;71) and his mother Helena of Bulgaria, Empress of Serbia (c. 1315&ndash;74). This would not be a&nbsp;unique case, since it happened before in the Church of St. George at Kurbinovo, where we find Emperor Manuil Komenos and his wife&nbsp;portrayed in the guise of&nbsp;Sts. Constantine and Helena, while in the Church of St. Panteleimon at Nerezi and the Church of&nbsp;the Virgin Mary in Ferre, members of the Komnenian dynasty could be read in the holy warriors. The Christ Child from the Ohrid icon no. 81 and young king Uro&scaron; from the narthex at De\u010dani Monastery resemble each other, and may have been painted by the same artist&nbsp;or from similar models. Both figures display similar shadows under the eyes,&nbsp;lips,&nbsp;eyebrows, same angle of view, with the top of the nose rendered differently. The paintings in the narthex at De\u010dani were completed when&nbsp;Uro&scaron; was about 11 or 12 years old (1347/48).<br />\r\nThe Ohrid icon of the Virgin and Child, I believe, was painted around 1343/44. There is no iconographical analogy and typology in Byzantine art to this type of Virgin with Christ child. There is only one black and white photo of the icon without the revetments, which shows&nbsp;only the Virgin&rsquo;s head with&nbsp;a golden halo. The dossier of the icon has a helpful drawing made in 1999/2000 by Kavkaleski. It reveals that quite a lot of the Virgin Mary&rsquo;s face, her upper part of the<em> maphorion</em>, Christ&rsquo;s hair, and his left shoulder were repainted. Given&nbsp;visual analogies, it could be possible that the icon was gifted to Peribleptos Church to commemorate Du&scaron;an becoming a tsar, while his son became a king.<br />\r\nIn Serbia, during&nbsp;the second quarter of the 14th century, appeared the so-called &ldquo;pictores graeci&rdquo; who were mostly Byzantine artists working along&nbsp;the Adriatic coast. An opinion has been expressed that the icon painter was a Byzantine artist working in the Adriatic region, either in Dubrovnik, Kotor, or Venice. But the artist could have also hailed from Italy, more precisely from Siena, as I suggest, due to the similarities between Duccio&rsquo;s triptych (1280), today at the London National Gallery, and the Ohrid icon.&nbsp;The details of the Virgin with child, in their garments and in the Virgin&#39;s hold of Christ&#39;s foot,&nbsp;are also evident in other paintings by&nbsp;Duccio and Cimabue.&nbsp;The <em>himation</em> is represented fallen around the child waist, which is typical for the playing Christ Child in contemporary Italian icons. When comparing some of Duccio&rsquo;s Madonnas with the Ohrid icon, there are similarities in the treatment of the eyes and the space between the eyebrows, as well as the cheeks.&nbsp;The cloak is usually geometrically modeled, but not as much of it as evident in the Ohrid icon. The garments&nbsp;of Christ display the most resemblance with Duccios&rsquo; Crevole Madonna now in the Museo dell&rsquo;Opera Metropolitana del Duomo in Siena. The arch of Christ&#39;s eyebrows is similar in both icons.<br />\r\nThere are also examples of&nbsp;icons and frescoes of the Virgin with Child with Christ looking to the side, but the neck is not as twisted. Usually, this appears in icons of the Virgin of Sorrow iconographic type, in which Christ turns to the angels. Several examples come from Crete, created between&nbsp;the 13th and 15th centuries. Yet, the Ohrid icon no. 81 has nothing in common with the Cretan examples. It finds more immediate visual parallels in Italian icons. The artist of the Ohrid icon was certainly familiar with Italian art of the late 13th and early 14th centuries. If this object was produced in the atelier of De\u010dani, it could mark an initial step in the stylistic formulation of the iconography that continued at the monastery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nFilipova, Sne\u017eana. &quot;Examples of Icons with Western Influences in Iconography in the Art of Macedonia: Case Study of the Icon Virgin with Child (inv. no. 81) from the Ohrid Gallery of Icons.&quot; <em>ICON 9: Ikone i ikonologija</em> 9 (2016):187-196.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This is the first scholarly article on the icon, including many color photographs, and detailing its iconography, style, and offering suggestions about the painter and analogies to other works.</p><p>Georgievski, Milcho. <em>Icon Gallery &ndash; Ohrid</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By&nbsp;Ida Sinkevi\u0107&nbsp;</em>|&nbsp;<em>Lafayette College</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nDe\u010dani Monastery in Kosovo is one of the largest and most significant Serbian medieval royal foundations. Now significantly restored, the monastery is encircled with an oval enclosure wall and surrounded by a number of currently obliterated anchoretic structures found in its vicinity and known as De\u010dani hermitages. The only extant and the most notable structure of the original, 14th-century monastic complex is the main church, the<em> katholikon</em>, dedicated to Christ Pantokrator.<br />\r\nThe <em>katholikon</em> was built between 1327 and 1335 by the Serbian King Stefan Uro&scaron; III, also known as De\u010danski (r. 1322&ndash;31) and his son, King and Tsar Stefan Du&scaron;an (r. king 1331&ndash;46, tsar until 1355). The founding of the church and its subsequent history have been documented in both contemporary and later literary sources that include biographies (<em>Vita</em>) of the royal founders written by Archbishop Danilo II and his followers and in the Monastic Charters issued by its royal patrons. The sources also reveal that the builder of the church was a Franciscan friar, Fra Vita from the coastal city of Kotor in today&rsquo;s Montenegro, whose inscription has been preserved above the south entrance into the narthex.<br />\r\nThe <em>katholikon</em> of De\u010dani is a royal mausoleum containing the remains of Stefan De\u010danski. Both the monumental marble sarcophagi of De\u010danski and his wife, as well as a specially decorated reliquary shrine that contained the remains of the King after he was canonized, are intact. The church also displays the largest preserved ensemble of monumental paintings in 14th-century Serbia and remarkable liturgical furnishings. The wealth of objects in the monastic treasury, which includes icons, silverware, and books, also testifies to the importance of this monastic foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nThe <em>katholikon</em> of De\u010dani monastery is distinguished for its royal patronage, for the sheer volume and wealth of its painted decoration, and for its unique combination of Byzantine and Western artistic and architectural features. The eclectic appearance of the <em>katholikon</em> represents a developed version of the uniquely Serbian visual idiom that was first seen in the12th-century Church of Virgin Theotokos at Studenica Monastery; it was subsequently adopted in the churches of the Ra&scaron;ka region and in the 14th-century royal mausolea.<br />\r\nThe exterior of the <em>katholikon</em> offers the appearance of a Western church. The facades of its elongated, basilican form are completely covered with polychrome marble revetments and decorated with the corbel-tables displayed at all levels of the roof as typical of Western Romanesque churches. The style of the sculpture, mostly concentrated around the portals, windows, and consoles, which display human heads, mythical creatures, and ornament is also Romanesque and Gothic in character, probably executed by artists from the Adriatic coast or from Italy. The richness of ornamental sculptural decoration, as well as the notable tympana reliefs displaying the <em>Baptism</em> (south portal), the <em>Tree of Life</em> (north portal), and the <em>Ascension of Christ </em>(west portal) contribute further to the Western appeal of the monument.<br />\r\nThe interior of the <em>katholikon</em> reveals a three-aisled narthex, a five-aisled nave crowned with a dome, and a deep altar space. However, the basilican outline of the church accommodates a centralized interior space, which was articulated to house the needs of the Orthodox liturgy. Essentially, the space of the naos is enlarged and connected with the subsidiary chapels of St. Demetrius (north) and St. Nicholas (south). Also, the walls have been replaced by tall parapets, thus removing the barrier and enhancing the sense of open central space in the upper zones and under the dome as was common in Byzantine churches. However, different spatial units are delineated by the carefully organized painted decoration that conforms to the liturgical needs of the Orthodox rite.<br />\r\nPainted by many artists for almost a decade (1339/40&ndash;47/48), the fresco decoration of the katholikon of De\u010dani reveals a high degree of programmatic integration suggesting that advanced and careful planning preceded its execution. Over 20 cycles of paintings include the Great Feasts, the Passion of Christ, Christ&rsquo;s Miracles and Parables, the Life of the Virgin, the Church Councils, the Menologion, Last Judgement, Akathistos of the Virgin, as well as the scenes from the lives of saints, notably a cycle of the Life of St. Nicholas. In addition, the church also displays unusually elaborate renditions of the Acts of the Apostles, the Genesis cycle, and the Old Testament prefiguration of Christ. Stylistically, the frescoes of De\u010dani relate to the main classicizing tendencies of late Palaeologan art of the first half of the 14th century, seen both in Serbia and throughout Byzantium and its borderlands, such as in churches of Constantinople and Thessaloniki, as well as in Macedonia and on Mount Athos. Due to a number of artists who worked in the church, however, its fresco decoration varies in the quality of individual artistic skill. The most masterful scenes, such as the Second Coming of Christ and the Dormition of the Virgin display a balance and symmetry in the composition, the harmony of light colors, as well as the fluid lines and soft physiognomies of the protagonists. Moreover, the royal patronage, recorded in inscriptions and numerous individual images and compositions, notably the Nemanji\u0107 Family Tree, is also revealed in the luxurious materials, such as the gold leaf applied to haloes, clothing, and furnishings.<br />\r\nThe unique combination of the Western and Byzantine features of the<em> katholikon</em> of De\u010dani created a new, iconic, and distinctly Serbian church type.

Since Greek printing was unable to establish itself in the Ottoman Empire in the Early Modern Period (with the exception of a short-lived press in Constantinople in 1627), Greek hierarchs consciously sought alternatives outside of the empire. While Western European printing centers like Venice are relatively well-researched, &ldquo;Eastern European&rdquo; projects of the Greeks, which ran over networks between Orthodox patriarchates, episcopal sees, monasteries, and monks as well as the Greek diaspora, have been rather neglected. The focus of the project is on books printed in Greek in such cities as Lviv, Vilnius, Ostrog (Poland-Lithuania), as well as in Bucharest, Snagov, and Ia\u0219i (Wallachia and Moldavia), etc. Another key area is the issue of &ldquo;translated&rdquo; (post-)Byzantine knowledge in the new context of Eastern Europe. Texts were literally translated from Greek into Old Church Slavonic, but also into vernacular languages like Ruthenian and Polish, as well as Rumanian in order to be printed and disseminated in Eastern Europe. Theological, legal and polemical treatises influenced the Early Modern process of the formation of an Orthodox confession. While the Byzantine legacy is often described outside of the Ottoman context, the Transottoman perspective allows by-contrast the analysis of the appropriation and transmission of Byzantine knowledge in Early Modern Eastern Europe in a larger context.<br />\r\nThe goal of this project is to write a monograph on this research subject as well as to prepare a data-base including information on the printing houses and printed production in the Transottoman context.<br />\r\n<strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nLeber, Taisiya.&nbsp;&ldquo;Christian-Jewish and Jewish-Christian Polemics in the Transottoman Context.&rdquo; In&nbsp;<em>Knowledge on the Move in a Transottoman Perspective:&nbsp;Dynamics of Intellectual Exchange from the Fifteenth to the Early Twentieth Century</em>, edited by Taisiya Leber, Dennis Dierks, Barbara Henning, Ani Sarsgyan, Evelin Diearauff.

The object of this project is the study of two very important coastal cities of Eastern Thrace, namely Ainos and Selymbria, both situated in the periphery of Constantinople. The chronological focus of the project is from Late Antiquity (3th century AD) to the early 20th century. The two cities have parallel historical courses and many common cultural elements.<br />\r\nThe primary components of this research are:<br />\r\n1) The location and documention (in photos and architectural drawings) of all the remaining monuments of various periods based on careful field research,&nbsp;<br />\r\n2) Systematic study of surviving artifacts (icons, sacred objects, etc.) as well as relevant published archaeological finds,<br />\r\n3) Research in various archives in Greece and abroad,<br />\r\n4) Systematic study of all relevant bibliography, written sources, old photos, aerial photos, old and new maps, drawings, etc.,<br />\r\n4) Study of oral testimonies in recorded interviews of old people, both old Greek and new Turkish residents, who retain in their memory old names, the location or description of lost buildings, etc.<br />\r\nBased on the findings and conclusions of the above research, the primary aim of the project is to study the history, urban planning evolution, architecture, and art of both cities, with the ultimate goal of portraying in topographical drawings and in 3D depictions the true form of the cities in various historical phases.<br />\r\n<strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nMamaloukos, Stavros. &ldquo;Middle and Late Byzantine church architecture in the periphery of Constantinople.&rdquo; In <em>\u0112r\u014ds Ktist\u0113s.

As a Long-Term Project it is pursuing three main lines of development:<br />\r\nThe first line of development comprises the ongoing scholarly work and resulting printed publications, i.e. the TIB volumes with their maps on a scale of 1: 800,000, following the Long-Term Project scheme of the Austrian Academy of Sciences until 2027.<br />\r\nThe second line of development is constituted by the scholarly, archival, and digital (re)processing of published and unpublished data of the TIB, which has been collected from 1966 until 2016. Since 2016 we are pursuing the aim to apply &ldquo;regressive engineering&rdquo; to these data sets through third-party funded projects. In this way we are and we will be able to digitize and process them, to save them sustainably within the technical framework of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, to present them to the scholarly community and interested public and to preserve them for future generations.<br />\r\nThe third line of development is a state of the art Geocommunication of current TIB content and results. Therefore, the TIB Balkans (M. St. Popovi\u0107) is creating, developing, and upkeeping the online atlas &ldquo;Maps of Power: Historical Atlas of Places, Borderzones and Migration Dynamics in Byzantium&rdquo; since 2019. Scholarly results and&nbsp;digital photographs of the TIB Balkans, i.e. from the TIB volumes 16 (&ldquo;Macedonia, Northern Part&rdquo;, M. St. Popovi\u0107) and 17 (&ldquo;Nea Epeiros and Praevalis&rdquo;, M. St. Popovi\u0107), and of related sub-projects of the TIB with a team of young scholarly co-workers (Bernhard Koschicek, Vratislav Zervan, David Schmid), are regularly embedded in English into a TIB OpenAtlas Database.<br />\r\nThe web application is developed in cooperation with the Department of Geography and Regional Research of the University of Vienna and enables live queries of the embedded data and the download of current map views as an image.<br />\r\n<strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nPopovi\u0107, Mihailo St. &quot;The &#39;Medieval Serbian Oecumene&#39;&nbsp;&ndash; Fiction or Reality?&quot;&nbsp;In <em>Byzantine Heritage and Serbian Art I:&nbsp;Process of Byzantinisation and Serbian Archaeology</em>, edited by Vesna Biki\u0107,&nbsp;37-43.

It is a self-governing part of the Greek state and comes under the spiritual supervision of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. Mount Athos is the largest Orthodox monastic community in the world and, for this reason, has been dubbed &ldquo;the center of Orthodox monasticism.&quot;<br />\r\nIts recorded history begins with the first appearance of ascetics thirteen centuries ago, which was followed three centuries later by the emergence of organized communities with rules, a structured program, and a communal life. The first organized monastery was constructed in 963 by St. Athanasios the Athonite and took the name Megiste Lavra; in essence, it constituted the beginning of Athonite monasticism, which has remained unaltered until the present day.<br />\r\nThroughout its history, the geographical boundaries of Mount Athos have hardly changed, a fact that is particularly true of its land border, which connects the Athonite peninsula with the mainland near the point at which Xerxes dug a canal in 480 B.C. to enable his large fleet to cross from Akanthos to Therme. On all its other sides, the peninsula is surrounded by sea, which also forms a natural boundary.<br />\r\nFrom a very early date, already in the first two centuries of its existence, Athonite monasticism flourished, leading to an increase in the number of monks residing on the Holy Mountain. This spectacular growth can be attributed mainly to the favor and full support that Athos received from the Byzantine emperors in the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as the Mountain&rsquo;s unique geographical location.<br />\r\nIn the early 13th century, after the Fourth Crusade, Mount Athos was occupied by the Latins for a short while, though without any adverse effects. This occupation was followed by a period of spasmodic pirate raids, mainly by pirates from the West, which soured relations between the Athonite monks and the Church of Rome. The situation deteriorated further as a result of the pressure exerted on the monks by Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259&ndash;82) in his efforts to obtain their agreement on the unification of the Churches at the Council of Lyons (1274), which they stoutly refused to give. The violent raids on the Athonite monasteries by Catalonian mercenaries in the early 14th century served only to strengthen the monks&rsquo; negative feelings toward&nbsp;the Latins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nDuring the 14th century, the Byzantine Empire suffered a serious political and economic decline, which had grim consequences for its internal affairs. The civil wars, the growing number of pirate raids, and the aggressive actions of the Ottomans in various parts of Europe created numerous upheavals in the Balkan region. This decline, however, did not affect Mount Athos; on the contrary, the 14th century ushered in a period of significant growth, both in terms of the creation of new monasteries (this period saw the foundation of Dionysiou, Pantokrator, and Gregoriou monasteries, as well as the renovation of Koutloumousiou, Simonopetra, St. Paul&rsquo;s, and Kastamonitou) and in terms of spiritual development.<br />\r\nThis period also saw a spectacular increase in the monasteries&rsquo; wealth, mainly as a result of the large tracts of cultivable land they owned, which led to an increase in the number of monks settling in the monastic communities. In the sphere of art, some of the leading examples of Palaiologan art were created on Athos during this time (such as the frescoes of the Protaton, Athos&rsquo;s central church), while the Hesychast movement, which was to be the most important spiritual event of the late Byzantine period, spread from Athos to other parts of Byzantium, making the Holy Mountain the most important spiritual center of the Byzantine Empire.<br />\r\nIn the last few decades of the 14th century, Athos temporarily came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire (1382&ndash;1402), although this did not cause the monasteries any serious problems. In 1424, however, it became a permanent part of that Empire, and a little later, with the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Byzantine Empire came to an end. This new reality was to bring about great changes in the Athonite republic, particularly in respect of its main institutions and the financial state of the monasteries. The main aim of the monks was to preserve the autonomy of their monastic community and to safeguard the monasteries&rsquo; properties, both of which they succeeded in doing, at least during the early period of the Ottoman occupation. Later, toward&nbsp;the end of the 15th century, the heavy poll tax that was imposed on the Athonite monks produced the first signs of an economic crisis, one that was to take firm hold with the full or partial confiscation of the wealthy metochia (dependencies) that had been developed by almost all of the monasteries in central and eastern Macedonia, as well as on the islands of the northern Aegean.<br />\r\nDuring the course of the 16th century, however, the financial state of the monasteries appears to have stabilized, as the use of the new metochia that had been purchased by or donated to the monasteries brought in a stable income, which proved extremely important in saving them from total bankruptcy. This stabilization of the republic&rsquo;s finances played an important role in generating a revival on Athos, with a burst of building and artistic activity in which Cretan painters decorated <em>katholika</em>, chapels, and refectories with impressive fresco ensembles.<br />\r\nThe fiscal problems of the Ottoman state in the 17th century gradually led to a period of administrative and financial instability on Athos, which, however, it managed to overcome largely thanks to generous donations from the rulers of Moldavia and Wallachia, who would also dedicate large Romanian monasteries to Athos as metochia. During the same period, the support Athos received from the Russian tsars in the form of large donations, which had begun in the 15th century, also grew. A typical example is the dedication of the Monastery of St. Nicholas in Moscow to Iveron Monastery in 1653, which led to the former becoming a center for the dissemination of Greek and Athonite culture throughout Russia.<br />\r\nIn conclusion, then, it could be said that the period mentioned above laid the foundations for the diffusion of Athonite spirituality and art. The spiritual movements that were created, the texts that were produced by learned monks and the large number of saintly men that lived ascetic lives on the Holy Mountain, all left their indelible mark on the subsequent spiritual development of Orthodoxy by establishing Athos as the place with the most authentic form of Orthodox monasticism. On the other hand, the unique artistic treasures that were gathered in the monasteries (manuscripts, icons, works of miniature art, etc.) and the artistic workshops that were (and continue to be) active in the Athonite republic (icon-painters, bookbinders, woodcarvers, etc.) succeeded in making Athos one of the most important centers of Byzantine culture. It is no accident that in our own time a contemporary artistic workshop on Athos has been chosen to decorate the new Church of St. Nicholas that has been erected at Ground Zero in New York.<br />\r\nIn a few words, it is fair to say that Mount Athos and the monks that live there represent the most important and most authentic continuation of the Byzantine tradition, a fact that is manifestly evident in the continuous, uninterrupted observance of the Byzantine monastic <em>typika</em> for over ten centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nPapachryssanthou, Denise, ed. <em>Actes du Pro\u0302taton</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Andrei Dumitrescu </em>|<em>&nbsp;New Europe College and the&nbsp;National University of Arts, Bucharest</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nThe former monastery of the Prophet Elijah (Sf&acirc;ntul Ilie) near Suceava, Romania, was founded in 1488 by the Moldavian voivode Stephen III (r. 1457&ndash;1504), and embellished with frescoes during the following decade. Located on the northern wall of the naos, the scene commonly known as the &ldquo;Imperial <em>De&euml;sis</em>&rdquo; depicts Christ as &ldquo;Emperor of emperors,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lord of lords,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Great High Priest,&rdquo; alongside the figures of the Virgin as <em>Basilissa</em> and St. John the Baptist. Both Christ and his Mother are represented in Byzantine imperial attire, wearing purple garments, <em>loroi</em>, and crowns. Additionally, the figure of Christ is shown with a <em>sakkos</em> and an <em>omophorion</em> that symbolize his eternal priesthood.<br />\r\nAt St. Elijah, the entire composition is surmounted by an Old Church Slavonic inscription taken from the Psalm 44/45: &ldquo;The Queen stood at your right in gold-woven clothing&rdquo; (9/11). Other textual insertions associated with the sacred figures enhance the rhetorical dimension of the image. For instance, the <em>Basileus</em> holds an open codex with a frequently quoted fragment from the Gospel of John: &ldquo;I am the light of the world&hellip;&rdquo; (John 8:12). Standing before the divine throne, the two intercessors present their petitions inscribed on open scrolls. Unfortunately, the prayer of the Theotokos is almost entirely worn out. Nevertheless, the inscription on the <em>rotulus</em> of St. John is well enough preserved in order to be deciphered: &ldquo;Listen to your Mother praying to you, o Creator.&rdquo; Considering its similarities with several Moldavian and Balkan versions of the <em>De&euml;sis</em>, one may assume that St. John&rsquo;s petition was originally integrated in a dialogic structure, as a complement to the Marian intercession. Thus, for a literate viewer from the late 15th century, the image would have acquired a performative character, enacting the heavenly pleas for the salvation of humanity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nDuring the final decades of the 15th century, the &ldquo;Imperial <em>De&euml;sis</em>&rdquo; was a relatively common theme in monumental decoration in Moldavian churches associated with the patronage of Stephen III, such as St. Prokopios in B\u0103deu\u021bi-Mili\u0219\u0103u\u021bi (post 1487), St. Elijah near Suceava (post 1488), St. George in Vorone\u021b (ca. 1496), and St. Nicholas in R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi (ca. 1490&ndash;1500). Examined through the lens of an Eastern European artistic geography, the local articulations of the theme illustrate the assimilation of an earlier iconographic type developed on the borders of the late Byzantine world.<br />\r\nScholars have placed the emergence of the iconography in the mid-14th-century churches of the Balkan territories under the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Ohrid, currently in the Republic of North Macedonia. Initially, the image emphasized almost exclusively the royal dignity of Christ and of the Virgin. For example, in the church of Hagios Athanasios tou Mouzake in Kastoria (ca. 1370&ndash;80), both figures were portrayed only with the imperial insignia. Given its location in the immediate vicinity of the chancel barrier, the &ldquo;Imperial <em>De&euml;sis</em>&rdquo; was interpreted as an iconic reference to the Eucharistic sacrifice, ritually activated in conjunction with the intonation of the Cherubic hymn during the Great Saturday celebration: &ldquo;(&hellip;) the King of kings and Lord of lords cometh forth to be immolated and given as food to the believers.&rdquo; The liturgical meaning of the image was further developed in subsequent decades. Therefore, on a late 14th-century icon from Veliky Novgorod, nowadays in the Assumption Cathedral in Moscow, as well as in the frescoes at Kovaljevo Monastery (ca. 1370&ndash;80), Christ is depicted not solely as Emperor, but also as Patriarch. Russian historians argue that the iconography of the &ldquo;Imperial <em>De&euml;sis</em>&rdquo; was disseminated in the Novgorodian milieu through the activity of an itinerant Balkan workshop. Plausibly, the occurrence of the theme in late 15th-century Moldavia was the result of a similar transfer of Balkan imagery towards the northern regions of the Orthodox East.<br />\r\nReshaping an earlier iconographic tradition, the &ldquo;Imperial <em>De&euml;sis</em>&rdquo; from the church of the Prophet Elijah represented a visual exegesis of the Psalm 44/45 (&ldquo;The Queen stood at your right&hellip;&rdquo;), through the polysemantic motifs of Christ as <em>Basileus </em>and of the Virgin as Empress. The typological connotations of the scene are accentuated by the nearby depiction of King David, introduced as an allusion to the royal genealogy of the Savior. In Byzantine sermons and liturgical poetry, David was portrayed as the Messianic prophet who foretold the Incarnation of the <em>Logos</em> from Mary, a female offspring of his kingly descent. Moreover, in the mural program of the church near Suceava, the notion of sacred monarchy is extended through the images of the Holy Emperors Constantine and Helena, located on the western wall of the naos. This sequence of royal figures is completed by the votive portraits of Stephen III, his third wife, Maria Voichi\u021ba, and his heirs, located on the west wall of the naos. According to local pictorial formulas, the donor is offering an architectural model of the church to the enthroned figure of Christ through the mediation of the patron saint, namely the Prophet Elijah. This particular iconographic configuration generated a visual discourse of legitimacy focused on the heavenly lineage of power, descending from the &ldquo;Emperor of emperors&rdquo; to the earthly prince who was symbolically acclaimed as a &ldquo;New David&rdquo; and a &ldquo;New Constantine.&rdquo;<br />\r\nThe association of the &ldquo;Imperial <em>De&euml;sis</em>&rdquo; with iconic representations of monarchic authority was a current visual strategy in late 15th-century Moldavia. Almost at the same time with the decoration of the church near Suceava, the <em>De&euml;sis</em> was used once again, in the <em>katholikon</em> of Vorone\u021b Monastery, as a pendant to the portrait of Stephen III who was simultaneously correlated with the crowned figure of the Martyr John, the emperor of the Persians. Thus, the Moldavian articulations of the <em>De&euml;sis</em> testify not only to the transmission of earlier Balkan models, but also to the local appropriation of several elements from the Byzantine imperial rhetoric, which were instrumentalized in a pictorial discourse of political legitimacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nAdashinskaya, Anna. &ldquo;Moldavian Votive Portraits with Scrolls: Toward Rhetorical Techniques Applied in Art of the Late 15th&ndash;early 17th centuries.&rdquo; <em>Revue Roumaine d&rsquo;Histoire de l&rsquo;Art, S&eacute;rie Beaux-Arts </em>54-55 (2017-2018): 3&ndash;45.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">Considering an ample repertoire of Old Church Slavonic inscriptions, the article investigates the interaction of votive compositions with intercessional texts in late medieval and early modern Moldavia.</p><p>Dagron, Gilbert. <em>Empereur et pr&ecirc;tre: &eacute;tude sur le &ldquo;c&eacute;saropapisme&rdquo; byzantine</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By James A. Rodriguez | Independent Scholar</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nIn the 14th century, brothers Dorotheos and Mark Blates, a Thessalonian metropolitan and an Athonite hymnographer, respectively, founded the Holy Monastery of Blatadon. Located near the northern summit of Thessaloniki, the site functions still as a monastery as well as a repository of Byzantine manuscripts and icons. One icon in its collection is bilateral, showing holy figures on its two prominent sides. This bilateral icon, which dates to the late 15th century, measures 3&rsquo;2&rdquo; &times; 2&rsquo;3&rdquo;. On one side is the <em>Crucifixion</em>, which depicts Christ on the cross between the Virgin Mary and apostle John. A miniature monk, the bilateral icon&rsquo;s presumed patron, stands within the left margin, raising his hands in imitation of the witnesses.<br />\r\nOn the reverse, a small 14th-century panel, which measures 9 &times; 8&rdquo;, is inset within a square-shaped niche carved in its larger counterpart. This panel&rsquo;s surface has spandrels raised above an arched recession, in which figures are divided among two stacked registers. A blessing Christ and two angels occupy the higher register, and the lower accommodates the Mother of God holding the Christ Child. An angel and scroll-bearing John the Baptist frame the holy family. The surrounding surface has not two but three stacked registers; read from highest to lowest, each includes: a blessing Christ flanked by orb- and staff-bearing archangels; the apostles Peter (at left) and Paul (at right); and, from left to right, Sts. George, Theodore Teron, and Demetrios, all bearing arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nImages represented on Byzantine icons, particularly icons completed as portable wooden panels, provided visual counterparts for saints commemorated and hymns recited during the Byzantine liturgy (that is, the liturgy of the medieval Orthodox rite). Nancy &Scaron;ev\u010denko has demonstrated, however, that the liturgy&rsquo;s continuous development and the dearth of references to icons in liturgical texts preclude assignment of a singular liturgical function to any icon. Moreover, &Scaron;ev\u010denko concludes: &ldquo;The [Byzantine] image always conveyed something wider than the text that might have inspired it.&rdquo; Verses inscribed on the inlaid panel attest the liturgy&rsquo;s influence, but patterns that characterize bilateral icons suggest&nbsp;&ldquo;something wider&rdquo;&mdash;namely, the possibility that the Blatadon example, particularly its hierarchy of holy figures, serves&nbsp;a calendric function.<br />\r\nGreek inscriptions (now mostly fragmentary) are visible on the small panel. Andreas Xyngopoulos connected these inscriptions to invocations and scriptural verses spoken at regularly performed liturgical services. Disseminated across the higher register are words from the <em>anaphora</em>, a Eucharistic prayer that expresses gratitude to God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit: &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy Lord of Hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.&rdquo; Written on John the Baptist&rsquo;s scroll are these words: &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God that takes away [the sin of the world&rdquo;] (John 1:29). Liturgiologists Miguel Arranz and Robert F. Taft have noted that a variation of the latter verse, found in Psalm 102, was spoken at the weekly monastic <em>agrypnia</em> (all-night vigil): &ldquo;[Bless the Lord] who forgives all thine iniquities.&rdquo; The overtones of the <em>anaphora</em>, portions of which a congregation recited at the Eucharistic commemoration of Christ&rsquo;s sacrificial body, presage an encounter with that body on the bilateral icon&rsquo;s reverse. If this and additional bilateral icons were placed within a church&rsquo;s sanctuary screen, as Sharon Gerstel has proposed, one&rsquo;s movement across the threshold would enact a progression from proleptic language to visual manifestation as the optical goal implied by the Baptist&rsquo;s imperative (&ldquo;behold&rdquo;) materialized in the <em>Crucifixion</em>.<br />\r\nLarge-scale bilateral icons appeared in the 12th century, yet the majority of extant examples date to the late 13th and 14th centuries. With few exceptions, narrative scenes represented on bilateral icons are those assigned to Great Feasts that opened with an <em>agrypnia </em>(the Dormition, for example). Saints whose liturgical services began with an <em>agrypnia</em> or a <em>pannychis</em>, a vigil of shorter duration, are those depicted prominently on bilateral icons. Late Byzantium&rsquo;s liturgical vigil offers one framework in which to study the bilateral icon&rsquo;s development and the rationale behind those images chosen for inclusion on bilateral icons.<br />\r\nReturning to the Blatadon example, each bust-length individual framing the small panel is clearly separated and can function as an independent icon inviting veneration. At the same time, Sts. Peter and Paul turn toward one another, reciprocally gazing across the inlaid panel. Not only did this image of mutually engaging apostles serve as the icon for the saints&rsquo; Feast (29 June), which was preceded by a vigil, but also, Blatadon Monastery has in its collection a 14th-century bilateral icon with Sts. Peter and Paul on one side, represented as they are here, and the Mother of God on the other. Flanking the inlaid panel&rsquo;s lower register, the two apostles serve additionally as witnesses at Christ&rsquo;s baptism&mdash;a Great Feast (6 January) assigned an <em>agrypnia</em> and whose iconic image includes&nbsp;John the Baptist, angels, and, in some instances, mortal men, all tending to a central Christ.&nbsp;A monastery located near Kaftun (Lebanon) houses a 13th-century bilateral icon with the Mother of God and the <em>Baptism</em>. The trio arranged in the larger panel&rsquo;s highest register approximates the icon assigned to the Feast honoring the <em>Asomaton</em>, or &ldquo;incorporeal beings&rdquo; (8 November), in which archangels hold a central orb enclosing Christ Emmanuel. A vigil opened this Feast&rsquo;s services, and a 13th-/14th-century bilateral icon with its iconic image resides at the Monastery of St. Paul on Mount Athos. Sts. George and Demetrios, whose individual Feasts (23 April and 26 October) opened with a <em>pannychis</em>, appear prominently on five and two bilateral icons, respectively.<br />\r\nThese rows of saints include individual figures and figural groups that represent or recall iconic images assigned to Feasts and Great Feasts whose services opened with vigils and occurred in six of the twelve months of the liturgical year. These same images appear prominently on bilateral icons of the 13th and 14th centuries. Thus, the Blatadon panel&rsquo;s celestial hierarchy represents a visual inventory of earlier bilateral icons with images assigned to Feast days, thereby functioning as a calendar of Feasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nArranz, Miguel, S.

    "text":"<p><em>By Jelena Bogdanovi\u0107 |&nbsp;Iowa State University</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nCozia is an architecturally and culturally important monastic complex situated in the Romanian principality of Wallachia. Cozia monastery and its <em>katholikon</em> (main church) dedicated to the Holy Trinity (1387&ndash;91) were established by Voivode (Prince) Mircea I of Wallachia (r. 1386&ndash;95 and 1397&ndash;1418). Set along the Olt River, Cozia retains segments of the original 14th century fortified monastic walls. Centrally located within the monastic enclosure is the iconic Church of the Holy Trinity. This sizable and lavishly designed structure is a major example of medieval Wallachian architecture. Built in recognizably Byzantine building technique that employs alternating courses of stone and brick, the monumentality of this structure is achieved through the sophisticated use of attenuated vertical proportions, extensive mural cycles on the interior, and delicately carved stone architectural sculpture on the exterior. The church at Cozia houses the tomb of its founder, Mircea I. It is considered the prototype for dynastic Wallachian triconch churches.<br />\r\nThe monastery was rebuilt and enlarged several times over its long history. Even when Wallachia was an Ottoman tributary state, its rulers maintained the monastery. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the paintings were restored, and additional structures and chapels built. Among remarkable features of the monastery are the two domed chapels at the corners of the eastern fortification walls overlooking the river Olt, as well as Bolni\u0163a (&ldquo;hospital&rdquo; / &ldquo;hospice&rdquo;), the triconch chapel located on a hill on the opposite side of the monastery. All three mentioned chapels, with emblematic domes set high on attenuated drums, offer today recognizably neo-Byzantine and Brancovean styles; the latter currently understood as an architectural synthesis of local, Byzantine, late Renaissance, and Baroque stylistic features. The monastery suffered destruction and neglect, especially during World War I and its aftermath, and had been heavily renovated between the 1950s and 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nCozia monastery with its <em>katholikon</em> of the Holy Trinity (1387&ndash;91) were established by Mircea I, also known as Mircea the Elder or Mircea the Great, considered one of the greatest rulers of his time. During his thirty-year reign, medieval Wallachia reached its greatest territorial expanse, socio-political stability, and gained relative independence from the Ottoman Empire. A remarkable patron of architecture and the arts, with the establishment of Cozia monastery Mircea I also founded an important cultural center and monastic school that was operational by 1415.<br />\r\nDespite major rebuilding projects over its turbulent history, Cozia monastery remains architecturally and culturally significant. Subtly incorporated into the picturesque landscape along the Olt River, Cozia is an extraordinary example of sophisticated understanding of architecture as both built and unbuilt environment. The segments of the original 14th century massive fortifications support the tall monastery walls, framed by the emblematic chapels with Byzantine-inspired domes set high on attenuated drums. This memorable image of both stunning natural landscape and long-lasting legacy of Byzantine architecture beyond its territorial domains, reveal Cozia as a monument of greatest importance for Romanian cultural history.<br />\r\nCentrally located within the monastic enclosure is the Church of the Holy Trinity, consecrated on May 18, 1388. This lavishly designed triconch structure is a major example of medieval Wallachian architecture. As a mausoleum for Mircea I, it is likewise considered the prototype for dynastic Wallachian churches. Constructed in recognizably Byzantine building techniques with alternating courses of stone and brick, the monumentality of the structure is achieved through the sophisticated use of attenuated vertical proportions, extensive mural cycles on the interior originally painted in 1390, and some still preserved, as well as delicately carved stone architectural sculpture on the exterior.<br />\r\nThe monastery and its <em>katholikon </em>have been renovated and enlarged several times since the 14th century In 1517, Voivode Neagoe Basarab (r. 1512&ndash;21) restored paintings in the main church and built the fountain with his name inscribed within. Voivode Petru of Arge\u0219 (1535&ndash;45), also known as Radu Paisie, established the triconch chapel dedicated to the Holy Apostles, known as Bolni\u0163a (&ldquo;hospital&rdquo; / &ldquo;hospice&rdquo;). The domed chapel dedicated to the Dormition of the Mother of God was built in the southeast corner of the monastery walls in 1583. Wallachian princes, \u0218erban Cantacuzino (r. 1678&ndash;88) and his nephew Constantin Br&acirc;ncoveanu (r. 1688&ndash;1714), additionally restored the paintings in the main church, refurbished monastic cells, and added a new fountain, a porch in front of the main church, a chapel within the monastic walls dedicated to All Saints (dated to 1710&ndash;11), as well as a watch tower. These later structures are done in the so-called &ldquo;Br&acirc;ncovenesc (Brancovean)&rdquo; style &ndash; a Romanian style of architecture that offers a synthesis of local, Byzantine, late Renaissance, and Baroque formal stylistic features.<br />\r\nThe question of Byzantine precedents in the architecture of Cozia is relevant from both disciplinary and methodological perspectives. In 1911, the Romanian civil engineer, architect, and art historian, Gheorghe Bal\u015f published a book that examined Serbian-Romanian connections in medieval architecture, and in 1930 an article that explicitly proposed that Serbian medieval architecture was the direct source of inspiration for medieval architecture in Romania. In 1933, the French Byzantinist Gabriel Millet published the current paradigm that Prince Mircea I built Cozia after contemporaneous Serbian royal churches, and in particular, the churches established by Prince Stefan Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107 of Serbia (r. 1370&ndash;89). Prince Lazar&rsquo;s court church, the church dedicated to the Holy Protomartyr Stephen in Kru&scaron;evac, also known as Lazarica, as well as his burial church dedicated to the Ascension of Christ in the fortified monastery of Ravanica, were both built around 1375&ndash;78. Like Cozia, studied as the prototype of dynastic Wallachian churches, the two Serbian churches are considered the prototypes of the Morava architectural group, so named because they were built in the Morava valley. All together, these three churches display undeniable architectural similarities &ndash; triconch architectural plans, recognizable Byzantine tectonics of the domed church done in stone and brick with lavish monumental decoration, as well as attenuated proportions and hierarchical clustering of the volumes.<br />\r\nThe extreme architectural and spatial resemblances between the churches in Cozia in Wallachia, and Lazarica in Serbia, indicate potentially the same builder(s), who may have used similar architectural designs for the two churches. Recently, it has been shown that Cozia is a Wallachian royal mausoleum and a peculiar type of &ldquo;court&rdquo; church. Larger than the Lazarica church, in its size approaching the <em>katholikon</em> at Ravanica, with regard to the function, the Cozia <em>katholikon</em> emerges as a hybrid of a court and a mausoleum church. Cozia and Ravanica also share the concept of a fortified monastery. Additionally, they share notions about urbanity outside of the city as being the result of a monastic architecture of diverse and multifunctional structures.<br />\r\nSerbian-Romanian architectural connections are supported by the studies of architectural historians Cyril Mango and Slobodan \u0106ur\u010di\u0107. They acknowledged that the Athonite monk by the name of Nikodemos, originally from Prilep, participated in the building of Cozia monastery. Today, the role of monks for the geographically widespread exchange of ideas and concepts about architectural designs is attested. It is historically relevant that Cozia itself was a major monastic and cultural hub in medieval Wallachia and the wider region.<br />\r\nBy enlarging the discussion about the territorial and chronological domains of triconch churches built by Serbian and Wallachian nobility between ca. 1350s and 1550s &ndash; including those in the territories of Mount Athos and their relationship to similar churches in Byzantine Greece &ndash; a more robust geographical and temporal exchange of architectural principles and practices in the development of Byzantine and post-Byzantine architecture have also been proposed. Such methodological frameworks and expanded chronology for studying Byzantine architecture and continual use of its design principles allow for a more holistic understanding of Cozia&rsquo;s architecture. Often neglected in the architectural discussions that focus on the older<em> katholikon</em> instead, Bolni\u0163a, the chapel at Cozia can be studied within triconch architectural typology and as a valid example within a broader history of Byzantine architecture. Similarly, the church and its complex have the potential to enrich studies of Brancovean religious architecture more broadly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nBal\u015f, Georges. &ldquo;Influence du plan serbe sur le plan des &eacute;glises roumaines.&rdquo; In <em>Les balkans [L&#39;art byzantin chez les slaves]: premier recueil dedie a la memoire de Theodore Uspenskij</em>, 277&ndash;294.

    "text":"<p><em>By Justin Willson | Princeton University</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nThe Zyrianskaia Trinity is a large format icon (119.3 x 73.7 cm) painted in tempera on three conjoined wooden boards. Dating to the late 14th century, it was brought to Vologda (where it is currently kept) by the physician Ia. Friz in 1788 from the Church of the Trinity in the village of Vozhem, about 30 kilometers from Iarensk. The panel has undergone at least two restorations: in Vologda, by A. I. Briagin (1930); and in Moscow, by E. M. Kristi (1973); and in recent years the surface has been cleaned. In many places the paint layer is badly abraded, and everywhere suffers from craquelure. Numerous holes, where a revetment was affixed to the panel (as was traditional), speckle the face of the icon. Given the size of the panel and the Vozhem church&rsquo;s dedication to the Trinity, the icon would have hung on the iconostasis, in the place reserved for the feast image.<br />\r\nThe panel depicts the story of <em>Abraham&rsquo;s Hospitality</em> of three visitors in the Book of Genesis 18:1&ndash;8. On the lower left, in front of the tall building, Sarah prepares food for the visitors, while Abraham, who approaches the table, is shown bringing a cup of wine to the angels seated in a circle around the table. Below, lying on the ground, is a calf, who alludes to Abraham&rsquo;s sacrifice of his son, an event that Church Fathers interpreted as a prophetic reference to the Eucharist. In the background stands a giant tree, designating the Oaks of Mamre where Abraham was resting in the heat of midday when the angels appeared before him. The bottom of the panel includes the Biblical verses written in the Perm alphabet - a Cyrillic script in use between the 14th and 17th centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nFor a century after its discovery in 1788, the Zyrianskaia Trinity was studied in the belief that it had been inscribed in the Perm alphabet by St. Stephen of Perm, who carried out a mission among the Komi people in the late 14th century. Described by the rhetor Epifanii the Wise (second half of 14th to first quarter of 15th century) as the inventor of the Perm alphabet, Stephen was a celebrated figure in Muscovite literature, lending a mystique to this panel. Other icons and crosses, detailed in late 19th-century inventories from Vologda, are known to have preserved the Perm alphabet, but none of them were as impressive and celebrated as this panel.<br />\r\nWhile it cannot be firmly linked to Stephen, the icon remains important for what it tells scholars about the medieval church&rsquo;s means of evangelizing among un-Christianized groups in the hinterlands of Russia. Inscribing the Biblical passage on the panel&rsquo;s base, the painter provided viewers with the textual source, in a local language, for the iconography. Over the course of the 15th-century, Russian bookmen were forced to defend the Church&rsquo;s iconographic tradition from the charges of heretics who critiqued the scriptural basis of icons. Arguments along these lines were obviously being set forth by competing factions among the Komi people. Several 15th-century codices include glosses, in the Perm alphabet, denouncing icons and quoting verses from the prophets familiar from iconoclast miscellanies.<br />\r\nThe Zyrianskaia Trinity shows the earliest stage in iconophile discussions. Depicting the image alongside the Biblical text, the painter takes for granted a close correspondence between text and image, a parallel that later heretics would critique. In the 15th century, Joseph Sanin, abbot of the powerful Volokolamsk Monastery outside Moscow, had to defend this very iconography against the charges that it was the invention of painters, and not based on scripture. In his <em>Letter to an Icon Painter</em>, delivered first as a series of homilies to the monks at Volokolamsk in the 1490s, Joseph explained not only the basic formula of the image &ndash; Abraham and Sarah serving a meal to their visitors &ndash; but long-established conventions, which an Orthodox believer would never have thought to question. Thus, Joseph addressed concerns about why the angels were shown with wings and haloes, held scepters in their hands and were seated on a throne-like bench. Responding to these questions, he explained the details through patristic literature, thus deepening the textual basis in which viewers needed fluency to understand pictorial forms.<br />\r\nThe Zyrianskaia icon thus can be read as revealing a tension within the desire to design self-contained icons that commented on themselves through inscriptions. The medieval painter was never completely bound by the textual source, and a discrepancy could arise between what the &lsquo;explanation&rsquo; (the inscription) said had been depicted and what the painter actually chose to portray. Depending on the audience, the Biblical text could suffice, for it accounted for the basic elements, but the text hardly exhausted the richness of a visual medium. That is, the painter&rsquo;s repertoire of visual conventions left behind the verbal economy of most scriptural passages. In cases where the audience was unfamiliar with the conventions, such as in missionary efforts or disputes with heretics, Church bookmen could have made room for the concept of an artistic &lsquo;tradition&rsquo; extending beyond textual guidelines. But intriguingly, as Joseph&rsquo;s <em>Letter to an Icon Painter</em> makes clear, they often sought an equilibrium between textual and visual details, and searched out other texts to account for details painters included in their compositions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nKazakova, N.

    "text":"<p><em>By Nicole C. Paxton&nbsp;| Yale University</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nWithin the narthex of the Church of Christ Pantokrator at De\u010dani Monastery, an extended genealogical tree maps the lineage of the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty. This imposing expression of ancestry dates to ca. 1346&ndash;48. It was painted under the auspices of Emperor Stefan Uro&scaron; IV Du&scaron;an (r. king 1331&ndash;45, emperor 1345&ndash;55), who completed the program of monumental painting at De\u010dani, originally founded by his father King Stefan Uro&scaron; III De\u010danski (r. 1321&ndash;31). Filling the southeast bay&rsquo;s east wall, the genealogy is positioned to the right of the central portal as one proceeds from the narthex into the naos. Parts of an extended menologion cycle &ndash; a visual hagiographical calendar of saints&rsquo; lives that encircles the entirety of the narthex &ndash; border the composition. Spanning the space of this bay, a raised plinth serves as a base for the marble font that functions, still today, as a vessel for the blessing of holy water on the Feast of Theophany.<br />\r\nThe dynastic genealogy displays seven generations organized into a schematic. At the center of the lowest register, a now-damaged image of Stefan Nemanja (St. Simeon) (r. ca. 1165/68&ndash;96) is the dynasty&rsquo;s &ldquo;root.&rdquo; Simeon&rsquo;s sons, Sava I and Stefan Prvoven\u010dani (&ldquo;First-Crowned&rdquo;) (r. grand \u017eupan 1196&ndash;1217, king 1217&ndash;ca. 28), are located on either side. Above, in the middle of the mural, Stefan Uro&scaron; II Milutin (r. 1282&ndash;1321) is flanked by his brother, Stefan Dragutin (r. 1276&ndash;82), and father, Stefan Uro&scaron; I (r. 1243&ndash;76). In the top register, the patron, Du&scaron;an, stands at the center, his young son, Stefan Uro&scaron; V (r. 1355&ndash;71), to his left and his father, Stefan De\u010danski, to his right. A lattice of scrolling vinework frames and connects these figures, and busts of additional family members blossom from interspersed axillary shoots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nThe genealogical tree at De\u010dani, painted following Du&scaron;an&rsquo;s proclamation as emperor, promotes the patron&rsquo;s expanded rule through a record of his lineage. The flowering vine that connects generations of Nemanji\u0107 rulers within the composition gleans from the language in Stefan De\u010danski&rsquo;s charter for the monastery; he refers to himself as &ldquo;Stefan Uro&scaron;, son and heir to [the Nemanji\u0107 ancestors&rsquo;] holy roots, the branch and only-begotten offshoot of my holy father, beloved by his heart more than his whole life, the mainstay and strength of his old age.&rdquo; As has been elucidated by Dragan Vojvodi\u0107, the vertically-oriented genealogy builds on a long&nbsp;tradition of processional dynastic imagery in medieval Serbian churches. Formally, the &ldquo;tree&rdquo; also borrows from late Byzantine depictions of Christ&rsquo;s lineage in the Tree of Jesse (an instance of which also appears as a pendant to the Nemanji\u0107 genealogy within the naos at De\u010dani). Most directly, however, the mid-14th-century family tree at De\u010dani stands in conversation with an earlier iteration of the same iconography in the southeast corner of the narthex at Gra\u010danica Monastery (1319&ndash;21). In this example, the very first occurrence of the genealogical tree in medieval Serbian monumental painting, the patron of Gra\u010danica, Du&scaron;an&rsquo;s grandfather, King Milutin, traces his lineage from the dynasty&rsquo;s founder, Stefan Nemanja.<br />\r\nClose comparative examination of the genealogies at De\u010dani and Gra\u010danica reveals that the positioning of some of the family members (and purposeful exclusion of others) offers insight into the patron&rsquo;s contemporary political circumstances and their aspirations for the future of the dynasty. At Gra\u010danica, a central, vertically-rising schematic accentuates Milutin&rsquo;s direct lineage; only he and the central figures of Stefan Nemanja, Stefan Prvoven\u010dani, and Uro&scaron; I wear halos (despite the previous rule of his older brother Dragutin from 1267&ndash;82, which ended in abdication). Indeed, the arrangement relegates Dragutin&rsquo;s sons, once heirs to the dynasty, to the left of Uro&scaron; I, at a comfortable remove from the crown. Moreover, looking to the future, Milutin includes, to his left and right, his daughter, Carica, and his named heir, Stefan Constantine (r. 1321&ndash;22), while completely omitting his oldest son, Stefan De\u010danski. In its purposeful disregard for an exacting stemma, the genealogy attempts to ensure De\u010danski&rsquo;s absence following his exile to Constantinople in 1314. Reality, however, eventually defied this contrived historical record after De\u010danski&rsquo;s return in 1320 and subsequent, eventually successful, struggle to gain the throne in the face of Constantine and his first cousin, Vladislav II (r. 1316&ndash;25). The genealogy at Gra\u010danica establishes itself as a site of political statement, a visual means to manipulate dynastic succession and secure its founder&rsquo;s place in history.<br />\r\nAround twenty-five years later, the genealogical tree at De\u010dani continues to address complicated, contested paths of succession and lays bare past upsets. Once more, a pictorial history advances the political position and objectives of the monastery&rsquo;s patron. In a riposte to De\u010danski&rsquo;s absence at Gra\u010danica, Du&scaron;an&rsquo;s genealogy revises the visual memory of his empire through a reciprocal excision of Stefan Constantine from the De\u010dani genealogy. The inclusion of numerous other princes and princesses, who propagate the interstices of the composition, renders the erasure of Milutin&rsquo;s younger brother all the more evident. Du&scaron;an did not, however, employ the same tactic for the figure of Simeon Uro&scaron; (r. despot 1348&ndash;55, 1359&ndash;69), the son of his father&rsquo;s second wife, Maria Palaiologina. While Simeon&rsquo;s presence did not pose a threat to Du&scaron;an&rsquo;s role as emperor, he had the potential to disrupt the eventual succession of his child, Stefan Uro&scaron; V. Indeed, after Du&scaron;an&rsquo;s death, Simeon laid claim to much of the empire&rsquo;s southern territories in Epiros and Thessaly, and proclaimed himself &ldquo;emperor of all Greeks, Serbs, and Albanians.&rdquo; With foresight of this possible outcome, the program at De\u010dani does not erase Du&scaron;an&rsquo;s half-brother, but rather depicts him in a way that deprives him of power. Represented as a minuscule bust flowering between Du&scaron;an and Stefan De\u010danski, Simeon wears a cloak with no insignia, and gestures in the direction of the emperor and his intended heir. In contrast, the bust figure of Christ Emmanuel above reaches from the heavens to bless Du&scaron;an&rsquo;s reign as two angels descend with a divinely sanctioned crown and imperial <em>loros</em>.<br />\r\nFor additional images visit <a href=\"https://www.blagofund.org/Archives/Gracanica/\">https://www.blagofund.org/Archives/Gracanica/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\n\u0106ur\u010di\u0107, Slobodan. &ldquo;The Nemanji\u0107 Family Tree in the Light of the Ancestral Cult in the Church of Joachim and Anna at Studenica.&rdquo; <em>Recueil des travaux de l&rsquo;Institut d&rsquo;&eacute;tudes byzantines </em>4&ndash;5 (1973): 191&ndash;195.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This article frames the Nemanji\u0107 genealogy at Gra\u010danica Monastery as the &ldquo;final visual manifestation&rdquo; of a prolonged development of political propaganda under King Milutin. \u0106ur\u010di\u0107 focuses on earlier dynastic imagery in the church of Joachim and Anna (the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Church&rdquo;) at Studenica.</p><p>Haustein-Bartsch, Eva. &ldquo;Der Nemanjidenstammbaum: Studien zur mittelalterlichen serbischen Herrscherikonographie.&rdquo; PhD diss., Rheinischen Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit&auml;t Bonn, 1985.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This dissertation offers a comprehensive overview of genealogical trees for the Nemanji\u0107 family in medieval Serbian monumental painting and relates its development to the iconography of the Jesse Tree.</p><p>\u0106irkovi\u0107, Sima. &ldquo;Between Kingdom and Empire: Du&scaron;an&rsquo;s State (1346&ndash;1355) Reconsidered.&rdquo; In <em>&Beta;&upsilon;&zeta;\u03ac&nu;&tau;&iota;&omicron; &kappa;&alpha;\u1f76 &Sigma;&epsilon;&rho;&beta;\u03af&alpha; &kappa;&alpha;&tau;\u1f70 &tau;\u1f78&nu; &iota;&delta;\u1fbd &alpha;\u1f30\u1ff6&nu;&alpha; </em>[Byzantium and Serbia in the Fourteenth Century], edited by Eutychia Papadopoulou and Dora Dialeti, 110&ndash;120.

    "text":"<p><em>By Dimitris Liakos | Ministry of Culture and Sports / Ephorate of Antiquities of Chalkidiki and Mount Athos</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nVatopedi Monastery on Mount Athos preserves twenty-two panagiaria&nbsp;dated between the 14th and the 19th centuries. The artworks presented here range&nbsp;from the 14th until to the 16th century, and are made out of wood, bone, and metal. They carry&nbsp;painted, relief, incised, or enameled decorations, and they consist either of a single or a double disc icon connected or unconnected. Some&nbsp;smaller panagiaria-pendants (<em>enkolpia</em>) are also included, but&nbsp;in a&nbsp;second type.<br />\r\nThe oldest panagiarion was carved in Serbia in the second half of the 14th century or in the early 15th century. It is of particular interest because an older pendant dated to the 12th century was embedded in its design. Three panagiaria&nbsp;dated to the 15th and 16th centuries&nbsp;come from workshops active in Russia (Novgorod) and in the northern Balkans. Another one is both painted and carved and, as it has been shown, was created on Mount Athos in the 16th century by a monk craftsman or by two cooperating monks, a painter and a woodcarver.<br />\r\nOnly two artifacts bear dedicatory inscriptions: the first one was donated in 1510&ndash;11 by the Great Komisos Neagoe, future ruler of Wallachia, Prince Neagoe Basarab (r. 1512&ndash;21);&nbsp;the second was a gift of Stefan and Helen, both Orthodox Greeks, probably active in the region of the Danubian Principalities during the second half of the 16th century.<br />\r\nThe most common representations on panagiaria are the Theotokos Blachernitissa, the Hospitality of Abraham, the Crucifixion, as well as the Hierarchs Nicholas, Gregory, and Basil. Neagoe&rsquo;s panagiarion, in which in addition to the usual representation of the Blachernitissa the scenes of the Ascension, Annunciation, De&euml;sis and other sacred figures are also depicted, reflects a common artistic trend among the workshops of the Danubian Principalities, namely the preference for a rather rich iconography in the double panagiaria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nA panagiarion is a small liturgical object, a dish, either single- or double-sided, decorated with the Theotokos Blachernitissa surrounded in many cases by other scenes, saints, evangelists, etc. A panagiarion is intended to carry the loaf of bread offered to the Theotokos during the ceremony of the Elevation of the Panagia, which takes place after the meal in the monastic refectories or in the course of the Orthros service.<br />\r\nThe portable nature of panagiaria and mainly their inscriptions allow us to learn more about their patronage. The oldest object, which comes from Serbia and dates to the second half of the 14th century or the early 15th century, could have been donated by a Serbian ruler or a dignitary from the Serbian court. It is known that Vatopedi had close relations with Serbia in this period, and Serbian rulers extended their patronage to&nbsp;Vatopedi, which is evident through monetary donations, gifts, etc.<br />\r\nThe panagiaria produced in workshops active in the northern Balkans, the Danubian Principalities, and Russia&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;regions that fostered firm connections to Vatopedi already from the 15th century onward &ndash;&nbsp;could be considered as gifts either by the local wealthy population or by traveller-monks. The latter, according to the written sources, upon their return from the dependencies (metochia) to their monasteries, used to bring with them liturgical objects. The mentioned donors Stefan and Helen could have been members of a family with commercial activities in the Danubian Principalities during the second half of the 16th century, a fact well attested by other artifacts endowed by individuals to Mount Athos.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is noteworthy that these objects bear Cyrillic and Greek inscriptions: the religious scenes are inscribed either in Greek or Cyrillic, yet the dedicatory inscriptions are written in Greek, namely in the donor&rsquo;s native language.<br />\r\nWith regard to the way that the panagiaria presented here were acquired by Vatopedi, the following is a possibility: some of them probably belonged to the monastery&rsquo;s dependencies in the Balkans and in Russia, from where they arrived later (at an uncertain time), since those churches or monasteries&nbsp;were abandoned or ceased to exist for several reasons.<br />\r\nFinally, the painted and carved wooden panagiarion belongs to a rather rare type, as far as I am aware. However, it can be added to the early production of the minor-scale wood carved artworks&nbsp;created by Athonite monks already in&nbsp;the 16th century. This object could have been donated to the monastery by the craftsman himself (or by collaborating craftsmen, a painter and a woodcarver). However, it is also possible that it was donated by a commissioner, layman or monk, who did not have the resources to order it from abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nLiakos, Dimitris. &ldquo;&Pi;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&tau;&eta;&rho;\u03ae&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf; &sigma;&epsilon; &pi;&alpha;&nu;&alpha;&gamma;&iota;\u03ac&rho;&iota;&alpha; &tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &mu;&omicron;&nu;\u03ae&sigmaf; &Beta;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&pi;&epsilon;&delta;\u03af&omicron;&upsilon; (14&omicron;&sigmaf;&ndash;16&omicron;&sigmaf; &alpha;&iota;.).&rdquo; <em>&Delta;&epsilon;&lambda;&tau;\u03af&omicron;&nu; &tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &Chi;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&kappa;\u03ae&sigmaf; &Alpha;&rho;&chi;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&iota;&kappa;\u03ae&sigmaf; &Epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;&rho;&epsilon;\u03af&alpha;&sigmaf;</em> 39 (2018): 427&ndash;438.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">The article&nbsp;deals with five panagiaria kept in the treasury at Vatopedi Monastery.

    "text":"<p><em>By Georgi R. Parpulov | University of Birmingham</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\n&ldquo;Tremble, my soul!&rdquo; (&Phi;&rho;\u03af&xi;&omicron;&nu;, &psi;&upsilon;&chi;\u03ae &mu;&omicron;&upsilon;), reads a short text at the bottom of this icon. Above it, a prostrate man repeats the words of the Good Thief (Luke 23:42) &ldquo;Lord, remember me!&rdquo; (&Mu;&nu;\u03ae&sigma;&theta;&eta;&tau;\u03af &mu;&omicron;&upsilon;, &Kappa;\u03cd&rho;&iota;&epsilon;). This prayer is uttered with the man&rsquo;s last breath, even as his soul departs in the shape of a small child. His body is depicted frontally, so that we observe it from above, the way the soul itself would see it at the last hour. An armed archangel whom the letter M identifies as Michael plants his feet on the fresh corpse, weighing the man&rsquo;s good works (&tau;\u1f70 &kappa;&alpha;&lambda;\u1f70 \u1f14&rho;&gamma;&alpha;) against his sins (&tau;\u1f70 &kappa;&alpha;&kappa;\u1f70 \u1f14&rho;&gamma;&alpha;). A hideous creature to the archangel&rsquo;s left declares that &ldquo;every sinner belongs to me, the devil&rdquo; (\u1f49 \u1f01&mu;&alpha;&rho;&tau;&omicron;&lambda;\u1f78&sigmaf; \u1f10&mu;&omicron;\u1fe6 &tau;&omicron;\u1fe6 &delta;&iota;&alpha;&beta;\u03cc&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon; \u1f10&sigma;&tau;\u03af). But this fiend is foiled: the man&rsquo;s good deeds outweigh the bad ones, and a guardian angel (&Phi;[\u03cd&lambda;&alpha;&xi;]) on the opposite, right-hand side receives the redeemed soul with the words &ldquo;Yet he who repents belongs to God!&rdquo; (\u1f08&lambda;&lambda;\u1f70 \u1f41 &mu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;\u03cd&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf; &epsilon;\u1f36&nu;&alpha;&iota; &tau;&omicron;\u1fe6 &Theta;&epsilon;&omicron;\u1fe6). In heaven, Jesus opens his arms: &ldquo;Today you will be with me in paradise&rdquo; (&Sigma;\u03ae&mu;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu; &mu;&epsilon;&tau;\u1fbd \u1f10&mu;&omicron;\u1fe6 \u1f14&sigma;&epsilon;&iota; \u1f10&nu; &tau;\u1ff7 &pi;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&delta;&epsilon;\u03af&sigma;\u1ff3). His meaning (Luke 23:43) is not obscured by the painter&rsquo;s imperfect spelling (&tau;\u1f78 &pi;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&delta;\u03af&sigma;&omicron;).<br />\r\nThe style suggests work of the early 18th century, probably by a Cretan artist. Judging from its small size (29.2 &times; 22.2 cm), the icon was used for private prayer at home, as a personal memento mori. Its back is almost empty, except for a roughly painted cross and for the short inscription IC XC NIKA (&ldquo;Jesus Christ is victorious&rdquo;); there are also traces from two transversely nailed slats, now removed, which once restrained the wood from warping. The edges are covered with red as a kind of frame that protects the painter&rsquo;s work. His gold and tempera pigments are on the whole well preserved. The devil, however, has been defaced in an act of pious vandalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThis is an icon with a message: it urges us to live virtuously by reminding us that &ldquo;man is destined to die once and after that to face judgment&rdquo; (Hebrews 9:27), that &ldquo;the wages of sin is death&rdquo; (Romans 6:23), that &ldquo;the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord&rdquo; (ibid.). To be effective, the reminder must be vivid. Vividness is achieved through the use of gold and of contrasting colors and by overloading the composition&rsquo;s right, symbolically good side. (Note that orientation is determined from within, so that &ldquo;right&rdquo; corresponds to Christ&rsquo;s right hand rather than ours.) The two nearly identical angels&rsquo; heads create emphasis by repetition; Michael&rsquo;s raised sword, the forearms of the guardian angel, and the upright anthropomorphic soul form parallel lines; the rich drapery of the angels&rsquo; clothing contrasts with the flaccid flesh of the naked devil. Besides being emphatic, the icon&rsquo;s message is focused (&ldquo;Tremble, <em>my</em> soul!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lord, remember <em>me</em>!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Today <em>you</em> will be with me in paradise&rdquo;): I am witnessing not another man&rsquo;s death but my own. The architectural background itself draws me &ldquo;into&rdquo; the image by means of several doorways and receding perspective.<br />\r\nThe painter&rsquo;s use of pictorial space and of visual parallel/contrast as rhetorical devices, as well as his rather naturalistic shading (most prominent in the clouds, in the drapery, and in Michael&rsquo;s breastplate), recall West-European art. The Baroque style reached many Greek regions through Venice, which ruled Crete until 1669 and held the Ioanian Islands up to 1797 (see <strong><a href=\"https://mappingeasterneurope.princeton.edu/item/the-icon-of-our-lady-skopiotissa-savina-monastery.html\">Our Lady Skopiotissa</a></strong>). But Italian painting contains no direct parallels for the scene depicted in our icon. Its central motif seems to have been invented by a Greek artist named Antonios Mitaras, whose <strong><a href=\"http://eib.xanthi.ilsp.gr/gr/showpic.asp?picpath=64_8bit_PE-IC6-DS2-Q3&amp;curtable=icons&amp;currecord=64&amp;vorder=1&amp;vmode=first&amp;fbclid=IwAR1F9_AG-xMySEzhNXOMUCJMdmj_WyKkKAk2SQmMpMsmdWDhMZalWmE_Al4\">sole surviving work</a></strong> also shows Archangel Michael receiving the soul of a dying man and also carries the exhortation &ldquo;Tremble, my soul, at the things you behold!&rdquo; (&Phi;&rho;\u03af&xi;&omicron;&nu;, &psi;&upsilon;&chi;\u03ae &mu;&omicron;&upsilon;, &tau;\u1f70 \u1f41&rho;\u03ce&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;). Nothing is known about Mitaras&rsquo;s biography, but his manner clearly predates that of the anonymous Yale painter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nChatzidakis, Manolis. <em>Ic&ocirc;nes de Saint-Georges des Grecs et de la collection de l&rsquo;Institut</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Maria Shevelkina | Stanford University </em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God in the Ferapontovo Monastery complex is the first stone church in the <em>Belozero</em> (White Lake) region of Vologda, Russia, built in 1490 by stonemasons from Rostov. The monument stands on a hilltop buttressed by five other structures and surrounded by a low wall, overlooking Lake Boradayevskaya. The church and complex are now part of the world UNESCO heritage sites, and is affiliated with the Kirillov-Belozersk Monastery, which is situated approximately twenty kilometers to the south on Lake Siverskoye. Founded in 1398 by St. Ferapont, the Ferapontovo Monastery was a bastion of Russian orthodoxy in its time and for four hundred years until the diminishment of monastic authority and its official disintegration after a brief period as a convent in 1924. The Monastery was critical to the consolidation of the Principalities of Rus under the authority of the Moscow rulers at the turn of the 15th to 16th centuries. In this period of transition, the iconographer Dionisy was commissioned by the wealthy aristocratic Archbishop of Rostov Iosaf (d. 1514), in coordination with the wishes of Grand Prince Ivan III (r. 1462&ndash;1505), to decorate the interior of the Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God with murals and an iconostasis. The project was completed by Dionisy and his workshop, which included his son Theodosy the Iconographer, on 8 September 1502.<br />\r\nThe interior and exterior wall decorations of the Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God are the only extant complete wall paintings of early-modern Rus. Considered the pinnacle of the master iconographer&rsquo;s artistic production, the wall paintings stand out for their emphatically fluid compositions, elongated forms, and luminous colors. Covering the entirety of the church interior and the exterior western entrance, the wall paintings create a state of airy transparency. They mark the culmination of a period of intense visual creativity within monastic Rus during the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nBefore working on the Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God, Dionisy&rsquo;s apogee, the artist took on numerous commissions for both iconostases and wall paintings. Dionisy studied at the Simonov Monastery, the largest spiritual center of Moscow, following the groundbreaking paths of Theophanes the Greek (ca. 1340&ndash;ca. 1410) and Andrei Rublev (ca. 1360&ndash;ca. 1430) who had worked and resided there as well. Together with his <em>staretz</em>, the &ldquo;great elder,&rdquo; Mitrofan (ca. 15th century), Dionisy decorated the Pafnuty-Borovsky Monastery. During the last quarter of the 15th century, Dionisy and his workshop traveled widely, painting monuments throughout Rus. The projects included Aristotle Fiorovanti&rsquo;s newly constructed Dormition cathedral in the Moscow Kremlin, and numerous other churches at the Saviour Kammeny, Volokolamsk, Chigasov, Paul Obnorsk, Kirill-Belozersky, and Saviour Priluki Monasteries. <em>The</em> <em>Life of Pafnuty of Borovsk</em> compiled by Vassian Sanin (Patrikeyev) in 1515 is the first written source that identifies Dionisy. It describes&nbsp;his&nbsp;work as &ldquo;miraculous.&quot;<br />\r\nThe Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God at Ferapontovo was situated within the already developed monastic strongholds of Rus, rapidly consolidating under the single Muscovite Principality of Ivan III. Dionisy&rsquo;s commissioner, Archbishop Iosaf, was heavily implicated in the controversies regarding monastic land ownership beginning in the 1490s. Several councils were convened to debate the issue, involving the participation of key figures of the monastic, hesychastic, and collective prayer movements including Joseph Volotsky (ca. 1440&ndash;1515) and Nil Sorsky (ca. 1433&ndash;1508)&mdash;both acquainted with Dionisy. The wall paintings of the Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God evidently reflect these contemporary issues, emphasizing the newly developed messianic theme of Moscow as the &ldquo;New Jerusalem,&rdquo; with scenes of the councils integrated into depictions of Old and New Testament narratives.<br />\r\nIn the wall paintings of the Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God, Dionisy appropriated the expressive portraits characteristic of the work of Theophanes and Rublev, minutely applying the style onto individual figures within scenes of collective prayer, nuancing the characterizations of each body and face. Dionisy&rsquo;s departure from his predecessors is evident through the rendering of complete scenes with detailed architectural and landscape elements, following the Byzantine tradition rather than the abstracted renderings developed in the mystical paintings of Rus. Furthermore, Dionisy collapsed time in his compositions by depicting scenes from the Old Testament to the New Testament scriptures, historical and contemporary events including the church councils, and liturgical rituals all within one space, fluidly unfolding the various narratives across the church structure. Monastic liturgical participants were enveloped in a wide variety of intimate and dynamic scenes and visions: celestial angels, hundreds of Saints and Prophets fully figured and in medallions, recognizable contemporaries, the figuration of the Akathistos hymn lauding the Theotokos, Christ in many forms, the Last Judgment on the western wall, liturgical objects such as the sacrificial chalice, and numerous ornamental motifs including the entire bottom register with completely unique circular medallions decorating the Tabernacle veil. The cacophony of figures, structures, and narratives facilitated a sense of participation in the teachings and experiences of Christian history, subsided into one time and space enacted during the liturgy.<br />\r\nThe most outstanding feature of the Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God is the wall paintings&rsquo; color scheme, consistent from the Pantokrator in the dome to the bottom register veil and the western exterior fa&ccedil;ade. Considering the sheer number of figures and scenes (at least 300), Dionisy masterfully unites the surface of the structure through color, creating a softened holistic unity. Mixed with limestone, the pigments of the wall paintings are transformed into hazy, lightened versions of themselves: golden ochre, mossy-green, gray-blue, lilac-pink, and white fade into one another producing an airy, hazy result. This is especially contrasting to the original iconostasis panels, also painted by Dionisy but no longer extant in full nor in-situ at the church, emphatically brilliant in their intense jewel-like colors. The wall paintings were thereby rendered not only for liturgical contemplation, but also facilitated a state of transcendence as they fused together into a shimmering lightness. Scholars of the Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God wall paintings have long noted the wall paintings&rsquo; unique and experimental forms and colors, contextualized by late 15th-century Rus. The Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God is one of the last monuments exhibiting this sense of freedom and dynamism, fettered by Church codifications and the rise in prosecutions unleashed by the intense authoritarian centralization of the following century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\n<em>Drevnerysskoe i postvizantiyskoe iskusstvo.

    "text":"<p><em>By Roland Betancourt | University of California, Irvine</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Thessaloniki Epitaphios, on display at the Museum of Byzantine Culture in Thessaloniki, is an embroidered liturgical textile composed of silk, gold, and silver thread on linen (2.00 x 0.70 m). On stylistic grounds, the textile has been dated to around 1300, emerging out of a major textile workshop in Thessaloniki given the excellence of its embroidery. The work finds its closest stylistic and iconographic parallels with the monumental wall-paintings of the Virgin Peribleptos (now St. Clement) in Ohrid, commissioned by Andronikos II Palailogos (r. 1282&ndash;1328); the paintings from around 1290 in the church of the Protaton Monastery on Mount Athos; and, the related frescoes from 1303 in the <em>parekklesion</em> of St. Euthymios in Thessaloniki.<br />\r\nBeyond the stylistic resonances with the Protaton, there are other convincing Athonite connections to the textile, including a series of mid-16th-century frescoes of the Celestial Liturgy from the monasteries of the Great Lavra and Dochiariou, which echo its size and dimensions as well as its plausible use in the liturgy. Furthermore, a <em>podea</em> (an apron hung before an icon) in the treasury of Hilandar Monastery on Mount Athos has been associated with the same workshop as the Thessaloniki Epitaphios. These various Athonite associations suggest a potential monastic use and a connection between Athos and Thessaloniki that is corroborated by the broader contextual history between the two sites during the 13th and 14th centuries.<br />\r\nDiscovered by Nikodim Kondakov in 1900 in the modern church of the Panagia Panagouda in Thessaloniki, the exact provenance or place of origin of the embroidery is unknown. Contextual evidence suggests that it was produced for the church of St. Panteleimon in Thessaloniki, which served as the <em>katholikon</em> of the Monastery of the Virgin Peribleptos, built around 1295&ndash;1315, and home to some of the key religious figures of the period. Given the quality and caliber of the object, it is likely that the textile was commissioned for the consecration of this church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe Thessaloniki Epitaphios is unrivaled in the quality of its embroidery and its impeccably preserved state. Set inside a thick border of circumscribed crosses, there are three different scenes adjacent to one another and divided by a thin, decorative strip of embroidery.<br />\r\nIn the center, there is the scene of the threnos or Lamentation, depicting the mourning of the sacrificed Christ. His recumbent body rests solemnly on a bier surrounded by angels, each labeled as &ldquo;Angels of the Lord&rdquo; (\u1f04&gamma;&gamma;&epsilon;&lambda;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; &Kappa;&Upsilon;). The first two angels in the procession are dressed as deacons: the first carries a <em>rhipidion</em> (liturgical fan) depicting a seraph upon it, and the second carries one that reads &ldquo;Holy, Holy, Holy&rdquo; (\u1f05&gamma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf; \u1f05&gamma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf; \u1f05&gamma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;), a detail that also runs down the carmine band on their garments. The angels following them are each labeled as well, but depicted as fully angelic bodies, clad in gold thread rather than the deacon garb, suggesting a blurring here between the earthly and celestial liturgies. While the first two are somber and sober in their approach, the third and fourth angels are distraught: the first stretches out covered hands toward the dead Christ while looking behind to the fourth angel who covers their mouth and clutches the side of their face in horror and grief. Below the Christ, other ranks of angels include two Thrones (winged wheels covered in eyes), a seraph (a face surrounded by six wings), and a cherub (depicted like a seraph, but with only four wings and holding a staff in the right hand). Both the seraph and cherub are labeled, &ldquo;Holy, Holy, Holy&rdquo; around their figures. At the four corners are depictions of the four Evangelists, labeled by name: John, Mark, Luke, and Matthew (moving clockwise from the top left), all looking toward the Christ.<br />\r\nOn the left and right scenes, the Communion of the Apostles is depicted: the communion with the wine is shown on the left and that with the bread on the right. The two scenes are very similar in their iconography, yet they are compositionally mirrored. In both scenes, six Apostles approach Christ, who is surrounded by two deacon-angels similar in appearance and attire to the ones in the Lamentation scene at the center. The center-most angel in both scenes carries a circular <em>rhipidion</em> featuring a seraph, just as in the central scene of the textile. The scene on the left with the communion of the wine is inscribed in the top-right corner with the words of institution: &ldquo;Drink of it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant&rdquo; (Matthew 26:27-28), though the text features phonetic variation from late-medieval Greek. Likewise, the right scene with the communion of the bread is inscribed in the top-left corner with the words: &ldquo;Take, eat; this is my body&rdquo; (Matthew 26:26), with similar phonetic divergences.<br />\r\nWhat is an <em>epitaphios</em>? While a textile known as an <em>epitaphios</em> is used today in the Eastern Orthodox Church on Holy Saturday, where it is deposited upon a tomb erected in the center of the naos, the uses of similarly named textiles in the Late Byzantine Church are less known. Particularly, the term <em>epitaphios</em> is used interchangeably with the Great A&euml;r. Although <em>a&euml;r</em> usually refers to smaller textiles used to cover the chalice and paten, more precisely known as the <em>poterokalymma</em> (chalice veil) and the <em>diskokalymma</em> (paten veil), the Great A&euml;r is a textile comparable in scale to the Thessaloniki Epitaphios. At that time it was also referred to as an <em>epitaphios</em> since it usually depicted the figure of the dead Christ upon the tomb and was used to cover both the chalice and paten (i.e. the body of Christ) upon the altar. The textile was carried around the shoulders, over the head, or by several figures during the Great Entrance, when the Holy Gifts (the bread and wine) were brought into the sanctuary at the beginning of the Liturgy of the Faithful in the Divine Liturgy. Depictions of the Great A&euml;r or <em>epitaphios</em> can be found in several monumental wall-paintings depicting the Celestial Liturgy, particularly at the moment of the Great Entrance, as seen in the church of St. Demetrios at the Markov Monastery in Skopje, Macedonia from 1375, and the church of St. Anthony in Vrontisi, Crete from 1425&ndash;50.<br />\r\nHow is the iconography of the Thessaloniki Epitaphios unique? While other examples of <em>epitaphioi</em> depict the dead Christ, often surrounded by angels, the overall iconographic arrangement and composition of the textile is unique. Most notably, the <em>epitaphios </em>is oddly long in width, standing at 2.00 x 0.70 meters, when compared to its squarer counterparts. One scholar has even suggested that the Thessaloniki Epitaphios was composed of two little a&euml;res, depicting the Communion of the Apostles, united with a Great A&euml;r, depicting the Lamentation, in order to justify its odd proportions. Nevertheless, the textile demonstrates a great deal of coherence and uniformity that challenges this reading, suggesting that the composition is intentional. This unique composition is likely to be the result of the usage of this particular textile during the Great Entrance. Most notably, the Communion with the wine and bread are inverted in their reading from left to right, an odd iconographic composition that is heightened by the placement of Christ at the far ends of the textile, rather than at the center abutting the Lamentation. While the Great A&euml;r/epitaphios is a large textile, often spanning the bodies of several participants, the more intimate scale of this example suggests that its usage was somewhere between the chalice and paten veils and the Great A&euml;r. Therefore, the scale, composition, and iconography of the textile suggest a particular and unique form of use.<br />\r\nHow was it used? It is likely that the Thessaloniki Epitaphios was wrapped around the shoulders of those carrying the rhipidia or even the chalice or patent as is attested in several mid-16th-century frescoes of the Celestial Liturgy from the Great Lavra and Dochiariou monasteries, as well on the so-called &lsquo;Pulcheria&rsquo; Panagiarion at the Xeropotamou Monastery on Mount Athos, Greece from the 14th century. This usage would have brought together the scene of the Communion of the Apostles in their expected order in the front of the wearer&rsquo;s bodies, resolving the oddities of the <em>epitaphios</em>&rsquo; iconographic program and composition.<br />\r\nThe closest extant textile to the Thessaloniki Epitaphios is the recently discovered Valadoros Epitaphios at the Benaki Museum in Athens, which bears a striking stylistic, compositional, and iconographic resemblance to the threnos scene. These two textiles are directly connected, and it is plausible, if not likely, that they were produced for the same church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nBetancourt, Roland. &ldquo;The Thessaloniki Epitaphios: Notes on Use and Context.&rdquo; <em>Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies</em> 55 (2015): 489&ndash;535.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This essay offers a comprehensive look at the Thessaloniki Epitaphios, providing a synthesis and summary of the research to date on the piece, while also providing an analytic study of the iconographic oddities of the textile and its function within the liturgy.</p><p>Bouras, Laskarina. &ldquo;The Epitaphios of Thessaloniki Byzantine Museum of Athens No 685.&rdquo; In <em>L&rsquo;art de Thessalonique et de pays balkaniques et les courants spirituals au XIVe siecle, Recueil des rapports du IVe colloque Serbo-Grec Belgrade 1985</em>, edited by Radovan Samard\u017ei\u0107 and Dinko Davidov, 211&ndash;231.

    "text":"<p><em>By Thaleia Mantopoulou-Panagiotopoulou | Aristotle University of Thessaloniki</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe church of Taxiarches (the Archangels Michael and Gabriel) dates to the Byzantine era, and underwent several modifications during its long life. The last extensive restoration and expansion project, which gave the church its present form, took place between 1952 and 1958 under the supervision of the architect Hercules Leontidis. Today, Taxiarches is a two-story church, consisting of two distinct parts, one &Beta;yzantine, and one Neo-Byzantine. The upper floor is a four-aisled basilica that has incorporated a Byzantine part at its eastern end. This latter consists of the bema flanked by two chapels, which are covered with different domical vaults and serve as parabemata. The bema and the<em> prothesis</em> have apses, five-sided and three-sided at the exterior respectively, and semicircular in the interior. The <em>diakonikon</em> has no apse. To the same era dates the eastern part of the central aisle, consisting of four pillars bridged by wide arches, three columns that are part of an arcade separating the southern aisle from the external one, and a small part of the northern wall. The eastern wall is covered by fine brickwork. The restoration work of the Byzantine part of the monument contains interpretative reconstructions and has not been published.<br />\r\nThe lower floor, partly below the ground level, consists of a well-preserved Byzantine crypt encompassed at the southwest by an L-shaped modern exonarthex. The crypt has the form of a three-aisled basilica and is partially built on the original inclined hard rock. Thick walls and pillars separate the aisles. A narthex is located at the western part. Arched niches (arcosolia) used for burials, stand along all the walls, indicating a funerary function. Arches separate the crypt into twelve compartments covered either with lowered semi-cylindrical vaults or with crude groin vaults, probably dating from different eras. Remnants of a fire can be seen in some compartments.<br />\r\nBefore the 1950&#39;s restoration, the monument had been a small single-nave church surrounded by a &Pi; shaped gallery, as described in a book published in 1952 by professor Andreas Xyggopoulos, who dated the original church to the late Paleologan period. The original Byzantine church had been converted to a mosque perhaps in the 16th century with the name &quot;\u0130ki \u015eerife Camii&quot; (the mosque with the double-balcony minaret). It was restored to the Christian religion in 1912 and, because the original Byzantine dedication had been forgotten, the church was dedicated to Taxiarches as a local oral tradition associated the minaret&#39;s two balconies with the pair of Archangels. Modifications to the original church were executed both when the building joined the Muslim religion and when it was restored again to the Christian one, further blurring the form of the original church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe church of Taxiarches is one of the most important monuments of the Palaiologan era and can be associated with the Serbian presence in Thessaloniki.<br />\r\nMorphological, constructional, and typological characteristics, in comparison with drawings made by the English architect William Harvey in 1908, and written sources both Byzantine and modern, lead to the conclusion that the part of the upper story attributed to the Byzantine era consists of two building phases. The collapse of its original construction was followed by a reconstruction, which incorporated the surviving parts.<br />\r\nThe characteristics attributed to this latter reconstruction phase link Taxiarches to the church of Agios Nikolaos Orphanos, dated by many researchers to the second decade of the 14th century and built by the Serbian king Milutin (r. 1282&ndash;1321). Both churches share, among others, a characteristic of particular importance: a triangle formed by a double dentil course on the east and west pediment, that seems to be the &quot;signature&quot; of the construction workshop. Surviving frescoes in the present church have been dated to the same period and are attributed to the painter Georgios Kalliergis, who had links to the Serbian community of Thessaloniki. These details, together with information extracted from two imperial golden bulls of 1316 and 1317, lead to the conclusion that Taxiarches can be identified as the dependency (<em>metochion</em>) of the Hilandar Monastery in Thessaloniki, dedicated to Agios Georgios. This should have been the second of the two churches built, or, rather, restored by Milutin in Thessaloniki at the beginning of the 14th century, as attested in the written sources. Its present dedication and the oral tradition mentioned above probably resulted from confusion with the Rotunda (dedicated originally to the Archangels and presently to Agios Georgios), as both monuments bear the same dedications and were situated in the same extended Byzantine neighborhood of Agioi Asomatoi (the incorporeal classes of Heaven).<br />\r\nThe original upper floor seems to have been a domed church. Its precise dating remains elusive as research is underway. All the known evidence points to the early 13th century. This should have been the <em>metochion</em> built by St. Savvas Nemanidis (1174&ndash;1236), who had realized its importance for the Hilandar Monastery, but also its usefulness as a Serbian post in Thessaloniki. The distinction of the majestic crypt building phases is a challenging puzzle. Differences in the wall thickness and brick and stone masonry techniques, various kinds of vaulting, as well as ventilation shafts point to different building programs which should be associated with the phases of the upper story. However, some constructional characteristics suggest even more, earlier building phases. The surrounding wall of the crypt is reinforced by buttresses similar to the ones used in buildings of the Hilandar Monastery on Mount Athos and other buttressed towers in Chalkidiki.<br />\r\nModern written sources attest to the probable existence of another church dedicated to St. Savvas in the vicinity of Taxiarches and now demolished. The three churches linked in one way or another to the Serbs are situated in the eastern part of the Upper Town and especially in an unusually large building block that also encompasses the surviving 14th-century Byzantine bath. An enticing idea is that this block hides a great building complex and includes the palace that Milutin had built during his stay in Thessaloniki.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nKissas, Sotirios. <em>&Tau;&omicron; &iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&rho;&iota;&kappa;\u03cc &upsilon;&pi;\u03cc&beta;&alpha;&theta;&rho;&omicron; &tau;&omega;&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&iota;&tau;&epsilon;&chi;&nu;&iota;&kappa;\u03ce&nu; &sigma;&chi;\u03ad&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&nu; &Theta;&epsilon;&sigma;&sigma;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;\u03af&kappa;&eta;&sigmaf; &kappa;&alpha;&iota; &Sigma;&epsilon;&rho;&beta;\u03af&alpha;&sigmaf;. &Alpha;&pi;\u03cc &tau;&omicron; &tau;\u03ad&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon; &Iota;&Beta; &alpha;&iota;\u03ce&nu;&alpha; &mu;\u03ad&chi;&rho;&iota; &tau;&omicron;&nu; &theta;\u03ac&nu;&alpha;&tau;&omicron; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon; &Kappa;&rho;\u03ac&lambda;&eta; &Mu;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;\u03cd&tau;&iota;&nu;.</em>&nbsp;Thessaloniki: University Studio Press, 2004.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This book offers an insight on the history of the artistic relations between Thessaloniki and Serbia in the Paleologan era, as well as&nbsp;research on the Serbian monuments in Thessaloniki.</p><p>Mantopoulou-Panagiotopoulou, Thaleia.&nbsp;&ldquo;&Omicron;&iota; &mu;&epsilon;&tau;&epsilon;&xi;&epsilon;&lambda;\u03af&xi;&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon; &nu;&alpha;&omicron;\u03cd &tau;&omega;&nu; &Tau;&alpha;&xi;&iota;&alpha;&rho;&chi;\u03ce&nu; &sigma;&tau;&eta;&nu; \u0386&nu;&omega; &Pi;\u03cc&lambda;&eta; &tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &Theta;&epsilon;&sigma;&sigma;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;\u03af&kappa;&eta;&sigmaf; &alpha;&pi;\u03cc &tau;&eta; &beta;&upsilon;&zeta;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&iota;&nu;\u03ae &sigma;&tau;&eta; &sigma;\u03cd&gamma;&chi;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&eta; &epsilon;&pi;&omicron;&chi;\u03ae.&rdquo; In&nbsp;<em>&Pi;&rho;&alpha;&kappa;&tau;&iota;&kappa;\u03ac &Tau;&rho;\u03af&tau;&omicron;&upsilon; &Epsilon;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;\u03cd &Sigma;&upsilon;&mu;&pi;&omicron;&sigma;\u03af&omicron;&upsilon;: &Beta;&upsilon;&zeta;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&iota;&nu;\u03ae &Mu;&alpha;&kappa;&epsilon;&delta;&omicron;&nu;\u03af&alpha;. &Theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;\u03af&alpha;-&Iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&rho;\u03af&alpha;-&Phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;\u03af&alpha;-&Delta;\u03af&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;-&Alpha;&rho;&chi;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;\u03af&alpha;-&Tau;\u03ad&chi;&nu;&eta;</em>, 461&ndash;485.

    "text":"<p><em>By Elisabeta Negr\u0103u | G. Oprescu Art History Institute, Romanian Academy, Bucharest</em><br />\r\n<strong>Overview</strong><br />\r\nThe Byzantine templon developed as a closing system for the sanctuary apse. It consisted&nbsp;in a row of low parapets interrupted in front of the altar and topped by columns supporting an architrave. Its lateral development differed depending on the plan of the church. The architrave could hold sculpted or painted images, often of a <em>De&euml;sis</em> expanded&nbsp;with angels and apostles. There are indications about the existence of such images from as early as the 6th century (ex: Hagia Sophia and St. Polyeuktos in Constantinople). From the end of the 11th century onward, the architrave could also contain a cycle of Great Feasts, at the same time when their number and selection began to be fixed. At St. Catherine&rsquo;s Monastery at Mount Sinai and in the monasteries on Mount Athos, the&nbsp;appearance of such image cycles&nbsp;on templa was linked to the presence of lay donors and pilgrims, to whom the icons reminded of the liturgical calendar, while the <em>De&euml;sis</em> was present to receive the prayers of those who attended the liturgy. The two cycles could coexist on architraves, but generally an iconostasis displayed a single register of images on the epistyle. The <em>proskynetaria</em> paintings of Christ and the Theotokos on the two piers flanking the front of the sanctuary apse in the cross-in-square churches, fixed in the 12th century, became the precursors of the so-called Despotic Icons of the next century. The royal doors (11th-century additions) began displaying the scene of the Annunciation by the 12th century.<br />\r\nThe earliest surviving examples of wooden templa date to the 14th century &ndash; Sts. Anargyroi church in Ohrid, Xenophon Monastery on Mount Athos. Toward the mid-14th century, the hesychastic trends began to influence both the form and the function of templa, encouraging a more mystical visual experience of the liturgy. The large despotic icons placed in between the columns (De\u010dani Monastery) prevented physical and visual access to the sanctuary. At the same time, it became common for a large painted and sculpted wooden crucifix to top the architrave (Pantokrator Monastery on Mount Athos, early 15th century).<br />\r\nFrom Wallachia, no templa from the 14th to the 16th century have survived. However, the existence of several disparate icons that have been preserved from the 16th century allows us to recreate how the structure of the iconostasis evolved in Wallachia in the first post-Byzantine century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nAccording to Andr&eacute; Lecomte du No&uuml;y, the restorer of the monastery of the Dormition of the Mother of God at Curtea de Arge\u0219 (1515&ndash;17) between 1875 and 1886, the initial iconostasis of the church founded by the Wallachian ruler&nbsp;Neagoe Basarab (r. 1512&ndash;21) was made of carved stone. The French restorer identified a series of stone elements that he attributed to the original templon. This altar screen&nbsp;was destroyed by fire and replaced in 1682, under Prince \u0218erban Cantacuzino (r. 1678&ndash;88), by another one carved in wood. The Syrian traveler Paul of Aleppo noted in 1657 that the original iconostasis had two precious Despotic Icons. The one of Christ, known as the Stabbed, was a Byzantine mosaic icon brought from Constantinople. A marginal cycle of scenes, with Greek inscriptions, on the icon recalled the history of the stabbed icon from the chapel of the Samaritan Well in Constantinople, recorded in Byzantine sources in 1389&ndash;91. The reverse of the icon showed the Crucifixion scene. Bilateral icons with this iconography were characteristic of the late Byzantine period.&nbsp;The Mother of God icon was an older wonderworking image&nbsp;as well. A drawing of the icon of the Mother of God with Child made in 1860 by painter Gheorghe Tattarescu depicted the duo as an Eleousa type. Both icons were reportedly lavishly decorated by Neagoe Basarab with gilded revetments and precious stones.<br />\r\nTwo early 16th-century icons with dimensions of 71 x 52 cm that form a <em>De&euml;sis </em>composition, pieces from the collection of the Romanian Orthodox Patriarchate now in custody at the National Museum of Art of Romania in Bucharest, are thought to come from an iconostasis dating from the period of Neagoe Basarab. One displays Christ Pantokrator on the throne and the other one shows St. John the Baptist and the Archangel Gabriel. A&nbsp;third example, showing the Mother of God and the Archangel Michael, survives&nbsp;in an 18th-century copy. They present conspicuous stylistic and compositional similarities with the icons of the iconostasis of Kru&scaron;edol Monastery (Serbia), which is an early 16th-century Wallachian donation and project. It has been&nbsp;proposed that the three panels were originally part of an architrave that topped the stone iconostasis at&nbsp;Curtea de Arge\u0219. Their dimensions are close to those of an icon (today lost) originating from Cotmeana Monastery in V&acirc;lcea (1387\u201289), depicting the Mother of God in prayer, mid-length (68.5 x 46.5 cm), dated around 1400 and thought to have come from a three-panel <em>De&euml;sis</em> composition crowning the original&nbsp;iconostasis of the <em>katholikon</em>.<br />\r\nA similar icon to those from the Romanian Patriarchate, depicting the Mother of God in prayer followed by Archangel Michael, now in the Museum of Hurezi Monastery (54.5 x 37 cm), was also part of a <em>De&euml;sis</em> decorating an architrave of an early 16th-century iconostasis from the court context of Neagoe Basarab.<br />\r\nThe <em>De&euml;sis</em> scene was usually extended with representations of the 12 apostles. The row could be composed of panels containing two figures in full silhouette, as shown in the icons at the Patriarchate of Bucharest, Kru&scaron;edol, and Hurezi, or a single full-length figure, as can be seen in an unpublished 16th-century icon kept at the church of the former hermitage at Peri (V&acirc;lcea County), depicting the Apostle Paul. According to stylistic features, the icon of St. Paul from Peri can be related to paintings such as the frescoes in the sanctuary of Cozia Monastery&#39;s infirmary church (1543), with which it shares similarities in terms of the manner of the paint strokes and the letter style of the inscriptions. The apostles could be represented also mid-length, as evidenced by the late 15th-century icon of St. Apostle Luke from Bistri\u021ba Monastery in V&acirc;lcea County (54.5 x 38,8 cm) and the icons of Sts. Apostles Matthew and Mark (59 x 47 cm) from the National Museum of Art in Bucharest (mid-16th century). The <em>De&euml;sis&nbsp;</em>with mid-length apostles was most common in the Balkans&nbsp;during the 16th century.<br />\r\nExcept for the larger two <em>De&euml;sis</em> icons from the Patriarchate of Bucharest, all the others display&nbsp;similar dimensions, of ca. 50 cm in height. Their considerable size leads us to believe that they have been part of iconostases that contained a single row of icons on the architrave, displaying the <em>De&euml;sis</em> scene extended with apostles. Virtually no Feast icon from the 16th century has been preserved. This fact leads us to suppose that the cycle of the Great Feasts was not a common feature on 16th-century Wallachian iconostases.<br />\r\nMost of the Wallachian churches were built on a triconch plan, which implied that the pastophoria were located in niches in the sanctuary apse. Thus, from the very beginning, the iconostases must have had side entrances, or at least a door corresponding to the prothesis area, for liturgical purposes (as the masonry templon at R&acirc;me\u021bi monastery in Transylvania, early 14th century). An icon from Curtea de Arge\u0219 representing the Threnos, today found at the National Museum of Art in Bucharest (65.5 x 111 cm), has been attributed to an early 16th-century workshop of Cretan influence. The panel preserves on the back the Cross flanked by the instruments of the Passion. The image also&nbsp;preserves&nbsp;numerous nail traces on the back. Its large dimensions indicate that it was likely not an icon for&nbsp;private devotion. More probably it could have been part of an iconostasis, maybe of the one of the two parecclesia of the monastery at Curtea de Arge\u0219, dedicated to St. Nicholas and Sts. Apostles. In the 16th-century Cretan environment, icons representing the Lamentation of Christ were placed in iconostases above the royal doors or the prothesis door.<br />\r\nThe assumption that the Threnos icon from Curtea de Arge\u0219 could have come from an iconostasis seems to be justified by the existence of another icon preserved today at the Ciocanu Monastery (Arge\u0219 County). The icon (31 x 61.5 cm) is painted on a panel carved in three sections ending at the base in a trilobed accolade arch. On the central panel is depicted Christ in the tomb between the Mother of God and Apostle John, and on the side panels there are two archangels. The work has been dated to the mid-16th century. Its smaller&nbsp;dimensions than those of the Threnos icon suggest that it could have decorated the arch of a prothesis entrance of a mid-16th century iconostasis, while the larger Lamentation one could have been placed above the royal doors of an early 16th-century iconostasis from the monastic complex at Curtea de Arge\u0219.<br />\r\nThe despotic icons of Christ and the Theotokos&nbsp;usually had large dimensions, measuring ca. 100 cm height and 70 cm width. Together with the royal doors and the side entrances, they could sum ca. 3.5 m in width, leaving little to no room for additional icons in the despotic row in&nbsp;the triconch churches, which usually had altar apses of ca. 3-4 m width in the 16th century. However, icons like those of the Birth of the Mother of God (mid-16th century, Ostrov Monastery) and Sts. Peter and Paul (late 16th century, the National Museum of Art in Bucharest) are a strong indication that, by the mid-16th century, icons of patron saints and feasts began to be included in the despotic row even in the smaller churches.<br />\r\nThe royal doors were most probably sculpted with palmettes or entrelacs surrounding the two panels forming the Annunciation scene, like in the late 15th-century to early 16th-century wooden examples found at Stoene\u0219ti-\u015eu\u015fani, preserved at the History Museum in R&acirc;mnicu-V&acirc;lcea, a work influenced by the Macedonian tradition of wooden sculpture. The doors hypothetically come from the late 15th-century Bistri\u021ba or Govora monasteries. Up to the early 17th century, Late Renaissance and Ottoman-inspired decoration replaced the Byzantine repertoire of Wallachian wooden sculpture. The royal door and the deacon entrances were covered by embroidered curtains, usually displaying the Crucifixion or the Deposition from the Cross.<br />\r\nThe wooden iconostases were most likely topped by a cross carved and painted with the scene of the Crucifixion. The iconostasis of the large cross-in-square church of the Metropolitanate of Wallachia, built between 1518 and 1537 in the capital city of T&acirc;rgovi\u0219te and demolished in 1889, was, according to Paul of Aleppo, topped by a beautiful cross painted with the Crucifixion scene. A fragment from the 1536 iconostasis cross from the Dormition of the Mother of God church in St\u0103ne\u0219ti (V&acirc;lcea County), found today in the History Museum in R&acirc;mnicu-V&acirc;lcea, a wooden piece painted with the scene of the Crucifixion, presents a type of sculpture with interlacements spread on the entire surface of the cross frame. Finally, the more modest churches probably had masonry iconostases or composed in a mixed technique of wood and masonry. Such masonry pedestals and door frames have been preserved at Bucov\u0103\u021b Monastery (1571\u201272), and a masonry painted templon was made at Snagov Monastery in the late 16th century (after 1563).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nCostea, Constan\u021ba. &ldquo;Unpublished works to complete the catalogue of Wallachian painting in the sixteenth century.&rdquo; <em>Revue Roumaine d&#39;Histoire de l&#39;Art.

    "text":"<p><em>By Jakov \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 | University of Belgrade</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Bachkovo Monastery, known in the past as the Monastery of the Holy Mother of God Petritzonitissa, was founded in 1083 by Gregorios Pakourianos (d. 1086), a high-ranking Byzantine military official (<em>megas domestikos</em>) of Georgian origin. Situated not far from the city of Plovdiv, ancient Philippoupolis, it remains, to this day, one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Bulgaria. The oldest monument of the Bachkovo Monastery that survives in its original form is the monastic ossuary. It is not known whether it was built at the time of the monastery&rsquo;s foundation because the Typikon does not mention it. It is possible that the ossuary was constructed after a few years, at the end of the 11th century, when a small burial ground became insufficient for the lack of space, or perhaps, on account of its frescos dated to the 12th century, even later. If the latter hypothesis is correct, it might be that its original pictorial program was planned in advance, together with the specific architectural design.<br />\r\nThe Bachkovo Ossuary is a rectangular two-story building raised outside the walls of the monastery on a steep slope of a hill next to the cemetery. The convenience of the two levels enabled the construction of a funerary chapel above a crypt designed to hold the earthly remains of the monks after bodily decomposition was completed. Therefore, the funerary service was performed in the chapel, whereas the bones were stored in the fourteen-floor openings of the crypt. It is also interesting that both spaces are preceded by the originally opened narthexes that were eventually walled up in the 14th century. While the Bachkovo Ossuary is not the only surviving monument of its kind (e.g. the two-story mortuary of St. Luke in the Nea Mone Monastery on Chios from the 11th century), it is the only ossuary that preserves a painted program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThough being the <em>megas domestikos</em> of the western armies of the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (1081-1118), Gregorios Pakourianos founded the monastery with an exclusively Georgian monastic fraternity. Trying to protect the monastery from annexation, he forbade the acceptance of Greek monks in the monastic community by inserting this prohibition in the Typikon. Therefore, the employment of the 12th-century master painter of Georgian origin (John Iviropoulos) is not unusual, as well as the inclusion of a few Georgian saints in the pictorial program of the Bachkovo Ossuary.<br />\r\nHowever, the care with which the program was devised is best perceived through the lens of performative and cognitive studies that problematize the relationship between viewer and image. The crypt is particularly interesting in that regard. A monumental representation of the De&euml;sis dominates the apse in the east and it is confronted by the fresco of the <em>Resurrection of Dry Bones</em> in the west &ndash; a vision witnessed by prophet Ezekiel. While virtually nothing is preserved of the painted prophets on the vault, fragments of heavily damaged standing figures of saints on the north and the south walls still remain. The compositional plainness of the scene of Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision emphasizes the prophet together with the transparent figures that rise from the heap of bones. Taking into account that the earthly remains were gathered in the floor openings creating heaps similar to the painted one, the image on the west wall was conceived as a spatial extension of the crypt, transforming the whole place into the Valley of Dry Bones from the biblical prophecy.<br />\r\nOn the other hand, the standing figures of saints on the side walls, from holy bishops and deacons in liturgical garments to the simply garbed holy monks, were conceived as to mirror the actual performance that took place in the crypt, i.e. prayer for the dead. This notion of the active participation of the painted figures in the service can also be attested in the naos of the upper chapel where the representations of All Saints are rendered on the side walls to the east. Finally, remembering that the De&euml;sis is a succinct image of the Last Judgment, frescos of the crypt&rsquo;s pictorial program were thematically interconnected, making a unified compositional whole that encompasses the physical space between them. Hence, the crypt was visualizing the Valley of Dry Bones, the place of resurrection of the Chosen People who will approach the seat of the (benevolent) Great Judge soon enough. Even before entering the crypt, monks became aware of its identity as the place of the elect because the entrance from the narthex is defined as the gates of paradise toward which the painted procession of saints is heading.<br />\r\nOn account of the profound complexity of the program, it is possible to suppose that the monks of the Bachkovo Monastery were gathering in the crypt after vespers on the Saturday of Souls before the Meatfare Sunday. That is the day reserved for the general commemoration of the dead and the Meatfare Sunday is a feast devoted to the Last Judgment. Thus, the Saturday service would have introduced monks to the Sunday feast, allowing them to relive the Judgment Day in the most direct way, while simultaneously allowing them to perform their duty of caring for the deceased brethren. It is also possible that the creation of the pictorial program was influenced by the theological concerns instigated by the rise of the Bogomil heresy in the region of Philippopolis (ancient Plovdiv) in the 12th century. Because the Bogomils challenged the doctrine of bodily resurrection, the Bachkovo Ossuary offered to its inhabitants the reassuring experience of &ldquo;reliving&rdquo; Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision.<br />\r\nIn the 14th century, the opened narthexes of the ossuary were walled up through the patronage of the Bulgarian Tsar Ivan Alexander (r. 1331-1371). Newly formed niches received ktetor portraits without interfering with the original conception of the pictorial program, but rather visually emphasizing particular individuals worthy of intercessory prayer. In the lower narthex were painted in pairs Gregorios Pakourianos with his brother Abasios and the two monks Georgios and Gabriel (most probably donors of the very ossuary), whereas the portrait of Tsar Ivan Alexander was placed in the upper narthex.<br />\r\nThe Bachkovo Ossuary testifies that visual programs of sacral monuments in the Byzantine world were carefully staged in order to instigate and define distinct experiences. Furthermore, they can be used as the relevant primary sources in revealing specific functional and performative aspects of church spaces, otherwise unobtainable from the written records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nBakalova, Elka, ed. <em>The Ossuary of the Bachkovo Monaster</em>y.

    "text":"<p><em>By Ljubica Vinulovi\u0107 | University of Belgrade</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe monastery of Matei\u010d is dedicated to the Dormition of the Mother of God. It is located in the village of Matei\u010d, near Skopje and Kumanovo in Skopska Crna Gora. The ktetor of this monastery is empress Helena Nemanji\u0107 (1310&ndash;74) wife of the Serbian emperor Stefan Uro&scaron; IV Du&scaron;an (r. as king 1331&ndash;46, as emperor 1346&ndash;55) and mother of the emperor Stefan Uro&scaron; V (r. 1355&ndash;71). It is believed that the church was built on the site of an older building dating to the 11th century. In the life of emperor Uro&scaron; V, Patriarch Pajsije (1614&ndash;74) states that the construction of Matei\u010d was started by emperor Du&scaron;an before the end of his reign, and that the construction was continued by his wife Helena and son Uro&scaron; after his death in 1355. This assumption was accepted by the older generation of researchers, so the construction and fresco painting of the church has been dated to the period after 1355. However, recent research has placed the construction and decoration of the monastery during the reign of Du&scaron;an in the period between 1348 and 1352. Empress Helena was the ktetor of this church, which is confirmed by her donor portrait, but also by the mural program.<br />\r\nThe <em>katholikon</em> has a cross-in-square plan with a dome on pillars rising above the central part of the naos. In the west is a narthex that is much smaller than in other royal foundations from the time of Nemanji\u0107. The <em>prothesis</em> and the <em>diakonikon</em> serve as chapels and they have smaller domes. They are connected to the narthex by an ambulatory, which is a system of subsidiary spaces located on the north and south sides of the central nave of the naos. Four domes were erected over the <em>pastophorion</em> and the narthex. These four small domes, together with the central one, give the church a five-dome appearance from the exterior. This type of building has as its prototype the churches of the Holy Apostles and the monastery of Christ Pantokrator in Constantinople. The painted program includes a large number of cycles such as the Great Feasts, the Passion of Christ, Christ&rsquo;s Miracles, the Life of the Virgin, the Akathistos of the Virgin, the Church Councils, the Acts and the Martyrdom of the Apostles, legend of the king Abgar, the cycle dedicated to the Ecumenical councils, as well as the scenes from the lives of saints: John the Forerunner, Demetrios, and Elijah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nHelena Nemanji\u0107 is the first empress from the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty. Her role in governing the empire, as well as her role in shaping the visual culture of medieval Serbia, is extremely important. She sponsored the monks and monasteries on Mount Athos, and she also supported the Catholic monasteries in Dubrovnik. Tradition also attributes to the empress the erection of the Church of the Assumption of the Mother of God in Nerodimlje, near the village of Uro&scaron;evac, where emperor Uro&scaron; was buried. However, her most important endowment is the Monastery of Matei\u010d. The monastery was an expression of her private piety and her personal connection with the Mother of God, who served as her protector. Helena&#39;s endowment also had a political dimension, which, like her private piety, is reflected in the architecture of the <em>katholikon </em>and in the program of frescoes.<br />\r\nThe painted image program of this monastery is quite complex. There are several scenes and cycles that rarely (or never) appear in churches from the time of the Nemanji\u0107, such as the cycle of the Acts of the Apostles, the legend of King Abgar, as well as the Genealogical Tree of the Nemanji\u0107, Komnenian, and Assen dynasties. The <em>prothesis</em> and the<em> diakonikon</em> are dedicated to the Mother of God and the Holy Archangel Michael, where their cycles are painted. The donor portrait is painted on the eastern part of the south wall next to the <em>diakonikon</em>. Empress Helena and Emperor Uro&scaron; are painted in full Byzantine imperial costume holding together a model of the church. Despite the fact that here mother and son are painted holding the model together, Helena was the main founder of the monastery. This is confirmed by her position within the composition. She is painted in the easternmost part of the south wall next to the altar. The Mother of God Hodegetria, the patroness of the church and to whom Helena offers a model of her endowment as a votive gift is painted in the lunette above the portal that leads from the naos to the <em>diakonikon</em>. Emperor Du&scaron;an is painted on the front part of the eastern pilaster of the south wall. Above the ktetor portrait are scenes from the Akathistos of the Virgin, which begins in the apse. These compositions speak of the Mother of God who defended Constantinople, but also of the Mother of God who is a chora, vessel of the uncontainable in whose womb Christ incarnated. This cycle also testifies to the fact that the Mother of God was Helena&#39;s personal intercessor and protector.<br />\r\nWhat sets Matei\u010d&rsquo;s frescoes apart from other programs of churches and monasteries on the territory of the Roman Empire is visual representation of the legend of King Abgar. This is a story that details the creation of the Mandylion. The Mandylion had an apotropaic function, which means that it provided sacral protection to Helena, who was buried in the church, as well as to monks and others who came to the monastery.<br />\r\nThe west wall of the nave displays a mini-cycle of the Dormition of the Virgin divided into five scenes. This cycle indicates the funerary context of the building and the role of the Mother of God as the intercessor of the human race. It is possible that Helena&#39;s tomb was in the southwest corner of the nave, which was a common place for the ktetor&#39;s tomb. If it was, the tomb certainly communicated with the scene of the Dormition, which promised Helena a place in the heavenly dwellings of the righteous through the intercession of the Mother of God.<br />\r\nThe program of the narthex testifies most directly to Helena&#39;s ruling ideology. This is expressed through the representations of the Ecumenical Councils in the vault and in the Genealogical Tree on the west wall. North of the western portal, The Genealogical Tree of the Nemanji\u0107, Komnenian, and Assen dynasties is painted. Rulers from the Assen and Komnenian dynasties are now painted for the first and only time within the Genealogical Tree of the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty. Empress Helena is painted on the very top of the Tree. This composition emphasizes her origins and genealogical connections with the Komnenian and the Assen.<br />\r\nThe program of the monastery of Matei\u010d has an encyclopedic character. Carefully selected cycles testify to the sublimation of eschatological time starting from the Conception of the Mother of God and Christ&rsquo;s incarnation through Miracles, the Passion, Christ&rsquo;s post-resurrection appearances, and to the final Eschaton, which served as an integral part to Helena Nemanji\u0107 self-fashioning as the ktetor of the monastery. These scenes are incorporated in a special way into the conceptual program of the mural cycles, which represent the sublimation of time, all the events that took place and will take place in Matei\u010d as the chosen place where Helena expects the Second Coming of Christ in her tomb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nDimitrova, Elizabeta.&nbsp;&ldquo;Zidno slikarstvo crkve Svete Bogorodice u Matei\u010du&rdquo; [The wall painting of the Church of the Holy Mother of God in Matei\u010d].&nbsp;PhD Dissertation, Belgrade: Faculty of Philosophy, 1997.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This unpublished doctoral thesis focuses on the painted program of the monastery.

    "text":"<p><em>By Maria D. Anghel | National University of Arts, Bucharest</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe image of the Man of Sorrows is depicted in the sanctuary of the fortified church in D&acirc;rlos, Transylvania, currently a region of Romania, which was a part of the Hungarian Kingdom during the Middle Ages. Built in two stages throughout the 14th century, the simple edifice comprises a compact longitudinal nave, culminating in a pentagonal choir toward the east. The two late-medieval niches in the chancel, namely, the Eucharistic tabernacle embedded in the northern wall, and the stone <em>sedilia</em> protruding from the southern side, presumably had a liturgical function. Although the architectural setting and the sculpted elements could be conventionally characterized as Gothic, the 15th-century frescoes preserved in the sanctuary illustrate a craftsmanship of Byzantine tradition. Nevertheless, the wall paintings incorporate certain traits of a formal and iconographic repertory with roots in Western traditions.<br />\r\nThe mural representation of the Man of Sorrows (<em>Vir Dolorum</em>) is inserted in between two stone trefoil arches on the gable of the <em>sedilia</em>. Therein, the full-figure representation of two Holy Kings of Hungary, identified as Sts. Ladislas and Stephen, would have corresponded to a seating place in the two-folded niche. Whereas the <em>sedilia</em> was an ecclesiastical furnishing specific to Western churches in the Middle Ages, the composition of the Man of Sorrows is rendered almost entirely according to Byzantine iconographic formulas. Thus, the bust-length Christ emerging from a sarcophagus is placed in front of the cross inscribed with the <em>nomina sacra</em> <em>(IC XC)</em>. Above his abdomen, the crossed arms of the Savior discreetly display the wounds of Crucifixion, while his head rests on his shoulder. The illustration of the disproportionately broader bust emphasizes the Eucharistic undertones of the image. Although the composition corresponds to the Byzantine schema, the eyes of Christ are partially open. On a closer examination, we may remark the fact that the eyes are not simply illustrated through a brown curved line, but through a teardrop shape that narrowly discloses his pupils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe origin of the depiction of the salvific sacrifice of Christ is generally associated with the remodeling of the monastic ritual in Middle Byzantine aristocratic foundations. More specifically, the image is presumed to have been created as an icon, which was used for the service of the Passion on the Great Saturday. One of the earliest variations of this theme is encountered on a 12th-century bilateral icon in the Metropolis of Kastoria, northern Greece, where the figure is portrayed bust-length with a close-up on the facial expressions. A subsequent development of this theme included Christ&rsquo;s abdomen and arms, crossed on his chest and presenting the wounds, as shown in the famous micromosaic from Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, Rome.<br />\r\nNot surprisingly, as it constituted the depiction of the body of Christ par excellence, the image was transferred to the walls of the sanctuaries and invested with powerful Eucharistic connotations. Usually, in the mural versions from the Byzantine cultural context, Christ appears as a corpse with his eyes closed. However, there are certain 14th- and 15th-century examples that illustrate the enlivened type, as it may be seen in the <em>prothesis</em> of Hagia Sophia in Mystra, in Greece (ca. 1370), and in the Serbian Monastery of Kaleni\u0107 (ca. 1418). Studies agree upon the fact that the detail of the open eyes was adopted from the Western iconographic formulation. This particular iconographic feature is also attested in the late medieval churches in the Hungarian Kingdom and Central Europe. For instance, in Transylvania, the vivified depiction is rendered twice in the sanctuary of the fortified church in M\u0103l&acirc;ncrav (ca. 1405) and bust-length in the sanctuary of the church in Nem\u0219a (ca. 1400).<br />\r\nIn the chancel at D&acirc;rlos, the predominantly Byzantine composition of the Man of Sorrows was introduced in a functional context associated with Western liturgical practices. The <em>sedilia </em>refers to the seats near the altar used by the priest and the deacon during the early moments of the celebration of the Mass. Although there is no conclusive research on this ecclesiastical furnishing in Central European edifices, some extant late-medieval documents from England testify to its exclusive usage by members of the clergy. In Transylvania, in the 15th-century church at \u0218mig, the &ldquo;hole-in-the-wall&rdquo;<em> sedilia</em> &ndash; in James Cameron&rsquo;s terms &ndash; contains an analogous composition of Sts. Ladislas and Stephen. Conversely, in the church at Curciu, an almost free-standing sitting niche from the 15th century preserves a sculpted trefoil ornamentation on its gable. Albeit distant, the figurative programs from extant medieval English examples are relevant in our case, as they display full-length figures of kings and members of the clergy, such as those in Westminster Abbey or in Easby Abbey. Given these iconographic occurrences, one may observe the proclivity toward&nbsp;visualizing authority, providing a pictorial setting for the clergy lodged in them. The latter were therefore enhanced by the powerful figures that accentuated their status as sole handlers of the precious body and blood of Christ. In the later Middle Ages, the modifications related to the liturgical and the devotional practices of the Eucharistic cult endorsed the clergy with the progressive domination over the holy body and blood of Christ. After the affirmation of the <em>real presence</em> of Christ in the Eucharist during the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), the sacrament ought to have been consumed only visually, as one of the Canons strongly discouraged the physical contact with the consecrated species. The attestation of the <em>real presence</em> endowed the Eucharist with powers similar to a relic, and the faithful were suffused with the &ldquo;desire to see the host,&rdquo; as Edouard Dumoutet puts it.<br />\r\nAt D&acirc;rlos, the Man of Sorrows surmounts the aforementioned saintly kings, Ladislas and Stephen. This pictorial correlation is not completely unusual in the Kingdom of Hungary. An enlivened full-figure of the Man of Sorrows appears in the cycle of St. Ladislas in the nave at Laskod, Hungary (ca. 1320&ndash;30), and in a comparable form near an unidentified saintly king in the nave at \u010cer&iacute;n, Slovakia (ca. 1380&ndash;90). In the broader context of Central Europe, the <em>Vir Dolorum</em> acquired a particular royal significance at the court of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV (1316-78). This image was placed above the altar and reliquary cabinet of the Holy Cross Chapel at Karl&scaron;tejn castle, asserting Charles as the rightful Emperor. Integrated in its iconographic setting at D&acirc;rlos, the Man of Sorrows presents a series of visual analogies with royal figures. The depiction of the dead Christ interacts both on a semantical and iconographical level with Sts. Constantin and Helena flanking the True Cross, as well as with the cycle of St. Catherine of Alexandria. Thus, one may notice the emulation of the attributes of the Passion portrait (the Cross and the sarcophagus) in the depictions of the Holy Emperors and the scene of Entombment of the martyr of royal descent, conveying a triumphalist dimension to the otherwise grievous implications of the sacrifice of Christ. Therefore, given its associations with the other mural depictions and with the function of the <em>sedilia</em>, the adopted Byzantine form of the Man of Sorrows emphasizes its original meaning, as King of Glory (<em>Basileus tes doxes</em>).<br />\r\nWhereas the West exploited only the sacrificial nuances of this theme, in the Byzantine context Christ&rsquo;s resurrection has been predominantly accentuated at the expense of his sacrifice, alternating between the King of Glory and Utmost Humiliation (<em>Akra Tapeinosis</em>). Probably, in the context of a Latin church in Transylvania, these&nbsp;triumphal allusions were evoked as a tool to further enhance the status of the clergy who held the supreme authority, based on their power to transform the wine and bread into the holy body and blood of the Savior. The visualization of authority was also visibly imbued in the iconographic context on the southern wall at the Catholic church in \u0218mig. Although there is no apparent depiction of the Man of Sorrows, the association of the two holy kings in the <em>sedilia</em> with the poorly conserved image of the Living Cross would have functioned in a similar manner, as the latter represents the ultimate pictorial representation of the triumphant Ecclesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nBelting, Hans. &ldquo;An Image and Its Function in the Liturgy: The Man of Sorrows in Byzantium.&rdquo; <em>Dumbarton Oaks Papers</em> 34&ndash;35 (1980&ndash;1981): 1&ndash;16.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">In this seminal article, Belting analyses the association between the Byzantine composition of the Man of Sorrows and the liturgical context of Holy Week.

    "text":"<p><em>By Jessica Varsallona | Centre for Byzantine, Ottoman, and Modern Greek Studies &ndash; University of Birmingham</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nMost of the information about the monastery of St. John of Petra dates to the Middle Byzantine period (843&ndash;1204). However, some legends suggest an early date for its foundation in connection to the Egyptian hermit, Baras, who arrived in Constantinople possibly during the Theodosian era (according to his <em>enkomion</em> written by John Mauropous in the 1070s). Other written sources refer to two subsequent major interventions on the monastery. The first one is John Neusteutes&rsquo; testament. John possibly re-founded the monastery between 1084 and 1095, with the support of Anna Dalassene, the mother of Byzantine Emperor Alexios I (r. 1081&ndash;1118). According to the <em>enkomion</em> of John Neusteutes, which Patriarch Kallistos (1350&ndash;53 and 1355&ndash;63) wrote, we know that the aristocrat John Ioalites enlarged the monastery, perhaps during the mid-12th century.<br />\r\nIn the Palaiologan period (1261&ndash;1453), St. John became one of the most famous monasteries of the Byzantine capital. After the fire of 1308, the Serbian King Milutin (r. 1282&ndash;1321) restored it and its hospital. In his letter, dated March 1381, Patriarch Neilos I Kerameos (1380&ndash;1388) stated that St. John of Petra was the most important patriarchal monastery of Constantinople, after St. John of Stoudios and St. George of Mangana. The link between Serbia and the monastery of St. John (established by Milutin) endured until the last years of Byzantium, when the Serbian wife of Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos (r. 1391&ndash;1425), empress Helena Draga&scaron;, made a donation to the monastery and the hospital, which, in the meantime, had also become a vital centre of humanistic culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe existence of a neighbourhood in Istanbul called <em>Kesmekaya</em> &ndash; literally &lsquo;cut rock&rsquo; &ndash; has suggested scholars of Constantinopolitan topography that the area was the Byzantine quarter of <em>Petra </em>(literally &lsquo;stone&rsquo;), where the monastery of St. John lay. In the area of <em>Kesmekaya</em>, several Byzantine structures partially survive or are well documented. The most prominent ones are the ruins of Odalar Camii, Kas\u0131m A\u011fa Mescidi, the cistern of I\u0307pek Bodrum, and Kefeli (or Kefevi) Mescidi. Also the Bog\u0306dan Saray\u0131 is located in this area.<br />\r\nAt Odalar Camii, archaeologists identified two main phases of the building: one possibly dated to the 9th or 10th centuries and the second to the mid-12th century. The damages of the fire of 1203 might have instigated the rebuilding of the upper church of Odalar Camii. Thus, archaeological data is, to a certain extent (e.g. two main phases), compatible with the history of the complex of St. John of Petra known from written sources, although not entirely. Certainly, Odalar Camii was in use during the Palaiologan period. Fragments of mural paintings and sculptural evidence suggest use, and this might strengthen the identification with one of the dependencies of the monastery of St. John of Petra.<br />\r\nBecause of its peculiar architectural features, which are not akin to other Constantinopolitan churches, the nearby Kas\u0131m Ag\u0306a Mescidi has been interpreted as the tower of the monastery of Petra, which was in close connection with the hypothetical <em>katholikon</em> of the monastery, the Odalar Camii. The core of Kas\u0131m Ag\u0306a Mescidi has been dated to the Palaiologan period, according to its masonry. Contemporary sources, such as Clavijo&rsquo;s account or a Short Chronicle, describe the tower of the monastery of St. John of Petra, its use for the preservation of the most precious relics, and the burials of aristocrats below the bell tower.<br />\r\nIn addition, the nearby I\u0307pek Bodrum cistern has been analyzed with a focus on its sculptural elements, such as columns and capitals. The dating of the cistern is contemporary with Anna Dalassene&rsquo;s refurbishment of St. John of Petra (1084&ndash;95), which included water management, supporting the identification of Odalar Camii, I\u0307pek Bodrum cistern, and Kas\u0131m Ag\u0306a Mescidi as parts of the complex of St. John of Petra.<br />\r\nNot far from this closely related group of buildings, there is Kefeli Mescidi. The word &lsquo;Kefeli&rsquo; might refer to the Caffa homeland of the previous &lsquo;owners&rsquo; who occupied the Latin church of &lsquo;San Nicola&rsquo; and &lsquo;Santa Maria di Costantinopoli&rsquo; (long identified as Kefeli Mescidi and Odalar Camii respectively). In the 19th century, scholars first identified Kefeli Mescidi as part of the Byzantine &lsquo;Monastery of Manuel&rsquo;, but then they proposed its identification as the church (or a dependency) of St. John of Petra. Based on its rectangular plan and its orientation toward the north, it is difficult to propose that Kefeli Mescidi was a church. More probably, this building, the masonry technique of which suggests a Palaiologan dating, was a monastic refectory (dining hall). It is impossible to determine at the moment which monastery it served. If we accept that the Odalar Camii was the <em>katholikon</em> of St. John of Petra, then Kefeli Mescidi might not be its refectory, since refectories are generally located in close proximity to the main church.<br />\r\nIn sum, scholarship has not entirely accepted the identification of Odalar Camii as the <em>katholikon</em> of the monastery of St. John, and Kefeli Mescidi has often been taken into consideration in relation to the identification attempts of St. John of Petra. It is worth noting that the monastery of St. John was very prosperous and sizeable. It probably included, to the south, the area from the Aetios reservoir and, to the north, the actual <em>Kesmekaya</em> area, including both the Odalar Camii and the Kefeli Mescidi. Thus, it is likely that it embraced more than a church within its perimeter. Perhaps, Odalar Camii was one of them, but not necessarily its <em>katholikon</em>. Moreover, in the area of Petra, there were other famous churches, such as St. Mary of Petra, the precise location of which has not yet been identified.<br />\r\nIn conclusion, though the identification of the single edifices is still unclear, the buildings of the quarter of Kesmekaya encourage reflections on the articulation of a Byzantine monastery within the city of Constantinople during the late centuries of Byzantium. They also encourage further study into the complicated afterlives of these buildings in the post-Byzantine period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nAsutay-Effenberger, Neslihan. &ldquo;Das Kloster des Ioannes Prodromos &tau;&eta;\u0301&sigmaf; \u041f&epsilon;\u0301&tau;&rho;&alpha;&sigmaf; in Konstantinopel und seine Beziehung zur Odalar und Kas&iota;m Ag\u0306a Camii.&rdquo; <em>Millennium</em> 5 (2008): 299&ndash;325.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This study identifies Odalar Camii and Kas\u0131m Ag\u0306a Mescidi as parts of the monastery of St. John of Petra.</p><p>Barsanti, Claudia. &ldquo;Una ricerca sulle sculture in opera nelle cisterne bizantine di Istanbul: la Ipek Bodrum Sarnic\u0131 (la cisterna n. 10).&rdquo; In <em>Vie per Bisanzio:&nbsp;VII Congresso Nazionale dell&rsquo;Associazione Italiana di Studi Bizantini, Venezia, 25-28 Novembre 2009</em>, edited by Antonio Rigo, Andrea Babuin, and Michele Trizio, vol.

    "text":"<p><em>By&nbsp;Aleksandra Davidov Temerinski |&nbsp;Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments of Serbia &ndash; Belgrade</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nGra\u010danica Monastery, the last endowment of King Stefan Uro&scaron; II Milutin (r. 1282&ndash;1321), was built in the second decade of the 14th century to serve as the seat of the Eparchy of Lipljan, with a representative church dedicated to the Annunciation (today dedicated to the Dormition of the Virgin). The founding charter, inscribed on an interior wall, dates to&nbsp;1321. By that time, the church was already completed, including its mural painting.&nbsp;An early Byzantine three-aisled basilica once stood on the site of Milutin&rsquo;s church, and after the establishment of Serbian ecclesiastical independence (1219), a small single-nave church was built on its foundations to serve as the seat of the Lipljan&rsquo;s Eparchy.<br />\r\nKing Milutin&rsquo;s five-domed edifice has a cross-in-square floor plan, an almost square naos, a deep sanctuary, a narrow western bay, and a two-storied narthex with a <em>katechoumena</em> (gallery). The central part of the building is surrounded by aisles, which incorporate the choirs and eastern chapels flanking the tripartite sanctuary. The church was built using the cloisonn&eacute; technique with horizontally arranged ashlars framed with brick, while the windows and domes were made exclusively of brick.<br />\r\nKing Milutin&rsquo;s church has preserved its original appearance to this day. An open exonarthex was added soon after the completion of the original building and has been partially rebuilt or changed several times since. The church is the only surviving structure of the original monastery. The painted program includes many narrative cycles, liturgical and symbolic compositions, and individual figures emulating the Palaiologan style. Among the few later frescoes in King Milutin&rsquo;s church, the 15th-century portrait of young Todor Brankovi\u0107 is particularly notable. The exonarthex was repainted twice in the 16th century after its original 14th-century frescoes had been badly damaged. The once rich library and treasury still preserve a small portion of their former collections: a few dozen manuscripts and some valuable icons, most of them from the post-Byzantine period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nAfter his political and military successes during the first half of his reign, the Serbian king Milutin carried out a process of &quot;Byzantinization&quot; in his country during the first two decades of the 14th century. When it comes to culture, this achievement was extraordinary: after 1300, among the most remarkable works of both Byzantine architecture and fresco painting were executed under the patronage of the ruler of Serbia.<br />\r\nLate Byzantine five-domed churches geographically, stylistically, and chronologically closest to Gra\u010danica were built in Thessaloniki (St. Catherine, Holy Apostles); in Serbia, its immediate predecessors were the churches of the Virgin Ljevi&scaron;ka and Staro Nagori\u010dino, also endowments of King Milutin. Gra\u010danica differs from the Thessalonian churches in its pronounced verticality, harmonious proportions, and the cubical drums of the domes inherited from the earlier Ra&scaron;ka tradition. The lower part of the building is enlivened with slender pilasters, arches, and windows, while its upper construction is much more dynamic, with unique double cross vaults at the intersection of which the central dome rests. The small domes in the corners are raised high on their square-shaped tambours, thus achieving a balanced pyramidal shape. The Gra\u010danica church represents a unique combination of the builder&rsquo;s creativity and his engineering skills.<br />\r\nThe exterior of the building partially disturbed the centralized interior characteristic of Byzantine churches, while the pronounced height of the walls and piers&nbsp;made it difficult to see the frescoes in the upper zones. The well-preserved and&nbsp;elaborate fresco program&nbsp;emphasizes three major themes: the dedication of the church to the Virgin, its function as the center of an episcopal see, and the intention to glorify the ruler along with his family and lineage.<br />\r\nThe Orant Virgin in the altar apse alludes to the Virgin representing the Church in the Ascension scene shown in the blind calotte above the altar. This visual parallel emphasized the connection with the Virgin as the instrument of Christ&#39;s incarnation and, consequently, the founding of the earthly Church, which alludes to its institutions, including eparchies. The sanctuary features scenes from the Life of the Virgin and&nbsp;her numerous Old Testament prefigurations.<br />\r\nThe naos is dedicated to Gospel cycles, starting with the Great Feasts, among which the compositions of the Harrowing of Hell on the east wall and the Dormition on the west wall stand out due to their size and significance. Extensively described in 26 episodes, Christ&#39;s ministry, such as his teachings, miracles, and parables, includes some unique compositions related to his teaching role and, again indirectly, to the episcopal function of Gra\u010danica. The cycles of Christ&#39;s Passion and his post-resurrection appearances, as well as the life of St. Nicholas, along with a painted calendar and a multitude of individual figures of saints, appear throughout the church. The northern chapel is dedicated to St. Nicholas; the dedication of the southern chapel is unknown, although a representative arcosolium suggests that it was intended for the burial of Ignjatije, the learned bishop of Lipljan believed to have advised the painters in formulating the iconographical program of Gra\u010danica.<br />\r\nThe eschatological themes in the narthex (Last Judgment) establish a close relationship with historical figures. The Nemanji\u0107 Family Tree, known only in Serbian churches, appears here for the first time as a dynasty-glorifying composition. The monumental monastic portraits of Milutin&#39;s parents, King Uro&scaron; (r. 1243&ndash;76) and Queen Jelena, to whom Christ Emmanuel brings monastic instead of royal insignia, are iconographically unique. The ktetor&#39;s composition in the arch leading from the narthex to the naos illustrates the divine investiture of the rulers, an iconographic concept previously reserved for Byzantine emperors: King Milutin holding a model of the church and Queen Simonis, daughter of Andronikos II Palaiologos, to whom Christ sends their crowns.<br />\r\nBased on the preserved signatures in King Milutin&rsquo;s earlier endowments (Bogorodica Ljevi&scaron;ka, Staro Nagori\u010dino) and the remarkable similarity of their painted ensembles to those in Gra\u010danica, the painting workshop is believed to have been led by Michael Astrapas of Thessaloniki. He is the artist responsible for the finest of Gra\u010danica&rsquo;s paintings, which share the iconographic, stylistic, and aesthetic characteristics of the art of Thessaloniki, the second city of the Byzantine Empire.<br />\r\nGra\u010danica&rsquo;s outstanding architectural exterior is matched by its equally valuable frescoes, making it one of the artistic peaks of Byzantine monumental art of its time. It also marks the end of an exceptional period of Serbian medieval history &ndash; the reign of King Milutin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\n\u0106ur\u010di\u0107, Slobodan.&nbsp;<em>Gra\u010danica, King Milutin&rsquo;s Church and Its Place in Late Byzantine Architecture.</em>&nbsp;University Park: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1979.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">The&nbsp;most comprehensive monograph of the history and architecture of King Milutin&rsquo;s Church at&nbsp;Gra\u010danica Monastery and its place in Late Byzantine architecture.</p><p>\u0106ur\u010di\u0107, Slobodan.<em>&nbsp;Architecture in the Balkans: From Diocletian to Suleyman the Magnificent, c. 300&ndash;1550. </em>New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">In this major work, the architecture of Gra\u010danica is briefly analyzed and placed in its wider historical and artistic context, relying on the results of new research on late Byzantine architecture&nbsp;(pp. 662&ndash;666).</p><p>Todi\u0107, Branislav.&nbsp;<em>Gra\u010danica.

    "text":"<p><em>By Elisabeta Negr\u0103u | G. Oprescu Art History Institute, Romanian Academy</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Piet&agrave; iconography, with roots in the devotional images known as Vesperbild (Vesper images) which visually illustrated a type of meditation to the Passion inspired by readings of the Vespers, appeared in the German milieu around 1300. By the next century, this spread to Italy and other areas of Europe, under the name Piet&agrave;. By the 1450s, it also entered the repertoire of Cretan icon painters active in Venice, Crete, and the Ionian Islands.<br />\r\nAn icon originating from the Ostrov Monastery in the former Principality of Wallachia, an object found today in the National Museum of Arts of Romania in Bucharest (inv. 11345/i 2), displays an unusual interpretation of the theme. Unlike all the other existing Greek examples, the Ostrov icon contains also a representation of its donor, Mili\u021ba Despina (1487\u20121554), a Serbian lady daughter of Despot Jovan Brankovi\u0107 (hence the title of <em>despina</em>) and wife of Voivode Neagoe Basarab, the ruler of the principality of Wallachia (r. 1512\u201221). She holds in her arms her dead son and heir to the throne, Theodosie, in a manner that consciously mirrors the Piet&agrave; scene. Her husband died on 15 September 1521 and was succeeded to the throne by their eldest son, Theodosie (r. September 1521\u2012January 1522), who was then a minor. Lady Mili\u021ba held the regency for her son. Theodosie died soon after, while on a trip to Constantinople, on 22 January 1522. In the icon, Despina is dressed in mourning noblewoman clothes, in a fur-trimmed coat, and her head is covered by a cap wrapped in a black veil. The mourning mother must have ordered the icon shortly after the death of Theodosie, arguably in the spring of 1522, during the Great Lent (hence its theme). Following the death of her husband and son, Lady Despina became a nun. The icon was brought by her to the Ostrov hermitage, the place to where she chose to retreat as a nun.<br />\r\nThe dimensions of the icon are 67.5 x 44.5 cm. Its frame was carved and attached to the panel separately. The icon was repainted in 1801. The original hilly landscape in the background was then painted with flowers and plants, a representation of Mary Magdalene holding the feet of Christ was added, and the contour of Mary&rsquo;s feet and of the left part of the body of St. John were retouched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe closest source for the Ostrov icon seems to be a composition used by the Cretan painter Nikolaos Tzafouris in a triptych from the 1490s, today found in the National Museum in Warsaw. The triptych&rsquo;s central panel displays the same compositional structure like the Ostrov icon, with John the Apostle mourning beside the Virgin holding Christ, set against the same transparent blue background. The painter of the Ostrov icon chose not to reiterate the common iconography of the Greek Piet&agrave;s, with the Mother of God sitting on a throne-like rock against a deserted background, which was chosen to reflect her inner state of sadness caused by the death of her Son. Instead, the artist sets the scene against a celestial blue background and a smooth, calm, and serene hilly landscape. Moreover, unlike other Greek 15th and early 16th-century Piet&agrave;s, the scene has a title written above, \u1f29 \u1f08&pi;&omicron;&kappa;&alpha;&theta;\u03ae&lambda;&omega;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf; (Descent from the Cross). Its composition is a reinterpretation of the usual iconography used for the Descent from the Cross scenes in the Byzantine tradition, through a hybridization with the Western iconographic theme of the Piet&agrave;. The Cross is flanked by the instruments of the Passion, a detail that appears in Italian Piet&agrave; paintings and, less often, in Cretan ones. In the Cretan icons, the Mother of God usually sits in a throne-like manner on a rock, and holds the head of Christ lying horizontally in her arms, as in the German Vesperbild sculptures. In the Ostrov icon, however, the Mother of God stands on her feet and obliquely holds the body of Christ descended from the cross, resting it on her knees. Nevertheless, a strong reminiscence of the Vesperbild is still present: the body of Christ is thin and emaciated, with visible ribs and wounds, exhibiting the reality of death. It does not display any more the classical Byzantine body features. He wears the crown of thorns on His head, and the Mother of God has her hair disheveled, illustrating her pain. Both details are absent from the Cretan Piet&agrave;s.<br />\r\nThe Mother of God&rsquo;s dress follows the post-Byzantine Italo-Cretan iconography with her ruby-red maphorion, but she does not wear the white veil that covers her head and neck, in the Western fashion, a detail commonly used in the Greek Piet&agrave;s. In the Ostrov icon, an even more humanizing theme accompanies the meditation to the Passion: the pain of the Mother of God for the dead Christ creates the occasion for representing in the mirror the human suffering of a mother for her dead son. We read in this emotional tendency a taste for sensibility that has been constantly manifesting in Eastern Christian art from the Middle to Late Byzantium and beyond. In the church of St. Nicholas Magaleiou in Kastoria (northwestern Greece), the mural painting completed in 1504\u201205 displays the donor, Vladislava, mourning her dead son while being blessed by Christ. The mother made the donation for the paintings of the church for the soul of her dead son. The picture combines a votive theme with a funeral one. The female figure makes the gesture of pulling her hair out in pain in front of the portrait of her dead son shown in prayer. The same ethos and sensibility seem to run through both this representation and the Piet&agrave; icon from Ostrov.<br />\r\nAlthough the subject of the Ostrov icon may have been dictated by the Serbian-Wallachian Lady Mili\u021ba herself, most likely the author of the icon was a local painter from Wallachia. He probably had connections with the center at Curtea de Arge\u0219, which fostered many valuable artists. In the icon from Ostrov, beyond the expression of pain, we are surprised by the tranquility emanating from the atmosphere of the scene. We glimpse, beyond the pain, the hope in the resurrection. One can distinguish in this calm and serene atmosphere the hesychastic tradition that the Wallachian painting had incorporated in the previous centuries from Byzantine Palaiologan art. The local artist of the Ostrov icon adapted the Cretan Piet&agrave; model in an original way, filtering its theme through the layers of the local Wallachian tradition imbued with hesychasm. The icon is a devotional image of Western origin reimagined in the Balkan context and designed as an image of private devotion and particular meditation for the donor Mili\u021ba Despina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nCastri, Serenella. &ldquo;In virginis gremium repositus.

    "text":"<p><em>By Grant Schrama | Queen&rsquo;s University (Kingston)</em><br />\r\n<strong>Historical Overview</strong><br />\r\nThe conquest of Constantinople in 1204 introduced a complex and rather chaotic period in Byzantine history. The former territories of the Byzantine Empire were divided amongst the participants of what modern historians refer to as the Fourth Crusade, and new regions were created in Greece and the Aegean including the Principality of Achaia, the Kingdom of Thessaloniki, and the Duchy of Athens. Three Byzantine successor states were also formed, that of the Empire of Nicaea, the Despotate of Epiros, and the Empire of Trebizond, made up primarily of exiled Byzantines from regions conquered by the Western Europeans. With the addition of Bulgarian, Cuman, Vlach, Turkish, and Genoese actors, the history of Frankish Greece and the Latin Empire of Constantinople can be difficult to follow and properly analyze. Its importance, however, in the history of Western European expansion, the Crusades, and Byzantium in the later Middle Ages cannot be stressed enough.<br />\r\nAs a microcosm of the region&rsquo;s history, Bulgaria&rsquo;s relationship with the Byzantine successor states is frequently overlooked. The most logical starting point is with the reign of the Bulgarian Tsar Johannitsa (r. 1197-1207), who expanded the Bulgarian territory into parts of Thrace and Macedonia with the aid of Vlach and Cuman soldiers; this put him in direct conflict with the Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Henry of Hainault (r. 1205&ndash;16). Johannitsa is most famous for orchestrating the death of Boniface of Montferrat (at least according to several sources), but he also formed an alliance with Theodore Laskaris I of Nicaea (r. 1205&ndash;21) to lay siege jointly to Constantinople, one which failed after a month. A similar alliance, this time also including Michael I Komnenos Doukas of Epiros (r. 1205&ndash;14/15), was concluded between Johannitsa&rsquo;s successor, Boril (r. 1207&ndash;18), and Theodore I Laskaris. Once more, Constantinople was not taken by the anti-Latin coalition.<br />\r\nThe reign of John Asen II (r. 1218&ndash;41) marked an important point in Byzantine-Bulgarian relations. Initially forming an alliance with the newly crowned ruler of Thessaloniki, Theodore Komnenos Doukas (r. 1215&ndash;30), the agreement soon crumbled and the Bulgarian tsar defeated the Epirot ruler at the Battle of Klokotnitsa on 9 March 1230. Theodore Doukas was captured and eventually blinded, while Asen gained control of Adrianople and expanded his empire from Great Vlachia to Ohrid and as far as Albania, turning it into the most significant political entity in the Balkans.<br />\r\nMuch like in the rest of Asia and Eastern Europe during the mid-13th century, the Mongols had a significant impact on Bulgarian expansion. In March 1242, they entered Bulgaria and ravaged the lands, resulting in the Bulgarians having to pay tribute. At the same time, relations between Bulgaria and the Empire of Nicaea deteriorated, with the Nicaean ruler John III Vatatzes (r. 1222&ndash;54) invading the tsar&rsquo;s territories. From September to November 1246, Vatatzes conquered a large tract of Bulgarian territory in Thrace and Macedonia, including Serres and Melnik. As such, the territorial gains that John Asen had made in the 1230s were now lost under the rule of Michael Asen (r. 1246&ndash;57) to the expanding Nicaean Empire, which was quickly becoming the new dominant power in the Balkans. In addition, the southern sections of the Second Bulgarian Empire were controlled by Theodore Komnenos Doukas and Michael II Doukas (r. 1230- 66/68), with the latter having conquered Ohrid at some point before 1246. A peace treaty was concluded between Bulgaria and Nicaea in the spring of 1247, where the former recognized its territorial losses and promised to join the Nicaean Empire in its fight against the Latins. Cooperative attacks began against the Latin Empire in summer 1247.<br />\r\nCordial relations between Byzantium and Bulgaria lasted until the death of John III Vatatzes on 4 November 1254. In late 1254, Michael Asen renewed hostilities against Byzantium and crossed the Maritsa River, conquering the theme of Achridos, as well as Skopion and the regions surrounding Adrianople. In response, the new Nicaean emperor Theodore II Laskaris (r. 1254- 58) advanced along the Maritsa to retake the recently lost territories, reaching as far as Beroe. The two sides would be in conflict until a peace treaty was concluded in 1256. For the remaining years of the period under focus here, Byzantine-Bulgarian relations would waver back and forth between coalition, uneasy peace, and open warfare. Such a fickle relationship was, of course, the result of the chaotic geopolitical nature of the region during the 13th century.<br />\r\nThe main sources detailing the Second Bulgarian Empire and its relations to the Byzantine successor states are those originating from Nicaea, Epiros, and Constantinople. The more important authors include Niketas Choniates, George Akropolites, Nikephoros Gregoras, and Demetrios Chomatenos. There are also the Latin chroniclers, including Geoffrey Villehardouin, Robert Clari, and the Chronicle of Morea, as well as the papal registers. Scattered Bulgarian sources do exist though, including the Synodikon of Boril and the Vision of Daniel from the Holy Books. Inscriptions, coins, seals, and frescoes complement the written sources and supplement the lack of literary records from the Bulgarian perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nBulgaria in the 13th century sits at the crossroads between the historiographies of Byzantium and the Crusades. Much like the other regions impacted by the Fourth Crusade, including the Balkans, the Aegean, and the Eastern Mediterranean, the historical scholarship is still very much scattered and developing. Unlike the multitude of studies on crusading to the Middle East or on Late Byzantine politics and society, the Latin Empire of Constantinople, Frankish Greece, and the Byzantine successor states have received far less attention from modern scholars.<br />\r\nWithin the Anglo historiography of the Fourth Crusade and its aftermath, Byzantine-Latin relations tend to be the focus of scholarly works, while Bulgaria&rsquo;s role is often included in larger, more general ones. George Finlay, Charles Brand, John V.A. Fine Jr., Florin Curta, Filip Van Tricht, and Jean-Claude Cheynet have all discussed the Second Bulgarian Empire within their broader studies on Byzantine and Balkan late medieval history. An exception is Alexandru Madgeau&rsquo;s recent monograph in English on the Asanids, which contains relevant discussion of the Second Bulgarian Empire&rsquo;s relationship with its neighbours, including the Byzantine successor states and the Latin Empire of Constantinople. Francesco Dall&rsquo;Aglio has also published several articles on the Bulgarian Empire, but his primary focus has been on the tsars&rsquo; relationships with the papacy. Despite this lack of scholarship in the West, Bulgarian and Romanian scholars have written more extensively on Bulgaria in the 13th century, although they often write in their native language, and thus their studies are not as accessible.<br />\r\nByzantine-Bulgarian relations during the period of exile have received even less attention in modern historiography. Alicia Simpson and Ruth Macrides examined the perceptions of the Bulgarians by Niketas Choniates and George Akropolites respectively, although such discussion was included in their larger examinations of the authors&rsquo; works themselves. Dimiter Angelov explored cultural relations between the two from the perspective of the Bulgarian sources. Angelov highlighted not only the very few written sources we have from Bulgaria during the period, but also the invaluable insights one can gain from the material evidence, including inscriptions, church frescoes, and official seals. These non-literary sources reveal Bulgaria&rsquo;s perceptions of the geopolitical world, as well as how the tsars perceived themselves in the much larger sphere of post-1204 Byzantium.<br />\r\nIn his work, Angelov noted that &ldquo;The feeling of cultural affinity with Byzantine civilization among the Bulgarians in the early thirteenth century is a large and complex question.&rdquo; For the few works that examine the relationship between the two in the post-1204 period, the religious identity of the Bulgarians is often explored. Bulgaria&rsquo;s Orthodoxy, and in general the cultural influence from Byzantium, forms a core aspect of the relevant historiography. In the period under focus here, Angelov rightly argues that Bulgaria&rsquo;s union with the Pope between 1204 and 1232 (which itself has a growing historiography) had no significant impact on its Orthodox identity or its cultural ties to Byzantium. John Asen&rsquo;s tendency toward Orthodoxy and his ambitions to rebuild the Byzantine Empire around the Orthodox faith have been highlighted by scholars, as well as his turning away from Catholicism. Bulgaria, as a frontier region, has thus been viewed as a battleground between the religious spheres of Latin Christendom and Byzantine Orthodoxy. Modern scholars have viewed other peripheral territories, such as Lithuania, in a similar light.<br />\r\nThere is importance then in examining Byzantium&rsquo;s relationship with Bulgaria during the 1204- 61 era. Bulgaria played a key role in the geopolitical sphere of the post-1204 Byzantine world, and was briefly the dominant power in the Balkans during the period. Through their alliances and military campaigns, the Bulgarian tsars had a role in shaping the political structure of the Latin Empire of Constantinople, as well as the reconquest of the imperial capital by the emperor in Nicaea. Bulgaria also best represents the period&rsquo;s complex political and cultural aspect, manifested in its changing alliances, union with the papacy, and continued connection to Orthodoxy. In sum, these embody the chaotic nature of thirteenth-century Byzantium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nAkropolites, George. <em>The History</em>, translated, with an introduction and commentary, by Ruth Macrides.

    "text":"<p><em>By Vladimir Ivanovici | University of Vienna &amp; Universit&agrave; della Svizzera italiana</em><br />\r\n<strong>Overview</strong><br />\r\nLight has occupied a central place in Christian theology and practice since the early centuries. Both in the Ancient Near East and in the Graeco-Roman tradition, manifestations of the divine were associated with light, which was held to envelop (or &ldquo;clothe&rdquo; cf. Ps. 104[105].2) divine beings. Several ways of offering a vision of the divine that involved light were developed and refined over the centuries in these cultural contexts. Both keeping with this tradition and going beyond it, John the Apostle identified God with light (1 John 1:5), a statement seemingly confirmed by the Transfiguration of Jesus (Matthew 17:1-8, Luke 9:28-36, Mark 9:2-8). Thus, from a protective layer that allowed humans to glimpse the divine without being consumed by the vision, light became the visual manifestation of a God who offered Himself to the senses. While in the case of the Eucharist one needed the &ldquo;eyes of faith&rdquo; in order to recognize the bread and wine as the flesh and blood of Christ, perceivable light was held to be similar (if distinct in intensity and source) with its divine counterpart. As a result, Christian communities used light to stage visions of the divine as early as the 3rd century.<br />\r\nAs the religion gained resources and attracted persons willing to repurpose antiquity&rsquo;s knowledge in order to promote the Christian faith, increasingly complex ways of using light were developed. Inside the spaces designed for the sacraments, natural (i.e., sunlight), artificial (i.e., lamps, candles), reflected (i.e., through the use of polished surfaces), and depicted light were used to make the spaces usable; to establish the holiness of specific areas, objects, and persons; to materialize the presence of the divine; and to represent the divine. Shaping the design, orientation, decoration, and iconography of the spaces, and constituting a mystical moment of encounter with the divine during the liturgical service, light was central to both the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and experience of Christianity in the Middle Ages.<br />\r\nAs the former provinces of the Roman Empire grew apart, distinct ways of using light emerged around the Mediterranean. These regional formulations were influenced by elements such as local building and decorative traditions, theological schools, or climate. Both the Romanesque and Gothic building styles in the Latin West, and the church types developed in the Byzantine East were shown to have used light in specific ways in order to confer a revelatory quality to church interiors. Medieval societies in the area between the Latin West and the Byzantine East, from the Balkan Peninsula to the Baltic Sea, developed their cultic architecture at the crossroads of these cultural poles. Thus far, only a few studies have addressed the use of light in churches in the area. Nevertheless, these have shown that rather than imitating the strategies used in Byzantium or the West, the know-how to manipulate light was adapted to complement local agendas. This attests to the local architectural and decorative styles being the result of careful design, and opens the discussion on knowledge transfer patterns in the area.<br />\r\nIn addition, studies of light in the post-Byzantine churches in Arbanassi (current Bulgaria) and P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi (current Romania) have demonstrated that the revelatory quality of interiors had political implications. The former context was a Christian enclave in the Ottoman state where light was used to reinforce the Christian faith by conferring a wondrous, awe-inspiring character to its rituals. The latter context saw the ruler of a political entity on the fringes of the former Byzantine state (the principality of Moldavia) use light in conjunction with architecture and iconography to consecrate the rule of his family and to strengthen belief in Christ, as the Ottoman presence in the area was growing.<br />\r\nThe small church at P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi also preserves a type of light effect thus far unattested in other contexts. The use of moving sunlight to unite specific areas inside the church or points in the mural decoration, and thus make political and/or theological statements, attests to either the innovative potential of these liminal cultural contexts or, if similar effects will be attested elsewhere, to their capacity to open new research foci.<br />\r\nThe study of light in churches north of Byzantium thus provides a<em> fil rouge</em> that draws attention to the local communities&rsquo; debts to Byzantine and Latin cultures, to their capacity to innovate, and to their search for distinct identities. Embedded in the architecture of local churches, these phenomena come to the fore when we reconstruct how light interacts with the space, decoration, and congregation, while considering the symbolic implications of the singular effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nDuring the past decade, there has been a growing interest in recovering the synesthetic qualities of religious rituals. Given its functional role in enclosed spaces and its rich symbolism, light has emerged as a privileged focus of research within this wider current. Light&rsquo;s particular capacity to offer an insight into the experience afforded by the space and ritual lies in it being simultaneously a category of architecture, decoration, iconography, and vision, as well as a topic of philosophy and theology.<br />\r\nIn addition, light has the capacity to interact in meaningful ways with other aspects pertaining to the sensorial sphere, such as incense smoke and sound. Thus, light brings together the fixed and transient elements that make up the setting of ritual performances. Nevertheless, most studies have focused on single aspects. Such analyses have added to our knowledge and have refined the methodologies needed for the study of individual aspects of the phenomenon, but ultimately failed to put to use the full range of meaning afforded by the study of light inside churches.<br />\r\nFuture studies have the responsibility to combine these foci and approaches in order to produce comprehensive analyses of the use and effects of light in specific churches. For the area north of Byzantium, in addition to applying existing approaches to local churches, such studies will require further analyses of sources in order to reconstruct key aspects such as the liturgical schedule, the location and shape of liturgical furnishings, or the artificial illumination sources and their locations. In this regard, the examples of Arbanassi and P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi have shown the potential of light studies in the area and invite further explorations along similar lines of inquiry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nJames, Liz. <em>Light and Colour in Byzantine Art, Clarendon Studies in the History of Art</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Elena Dana Prioteasa | Institute of Archaeology and History of Art, Cluj-Napoca</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Orthodox church of the Dormition of the Virgin is one of the testimonies to the medieval life of the Romanians in the Hungarian Kingdom. The Romanian district of H\u0103lmagiu is repeatedly mentioned, during the late Middle Ages, as an appurtenance of the castle of \u0218iria (Vil&aacute;gosvar), in the Zar&aacute;nd County. The voivodes of H\u0103lmagiu, local leaders who had administrative and military attributions, occasionally appear in the written sources, starting in the 14th century. The oldest votive inscription in the church suggests that one of them together with his brother were the ktetors of the church around 1400. The partially preserved inscription, situated on the triumphal arch of the church, has been read as follows: &ldquo;By the hand of \u017dupan Moga and of his brother they made it anew.&rdquo; Judging by the preserved documents, the family Moga of H\u0103lmagiu enjoyed economic and social prosperity in the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nThe architecture of the church is common for contemporary Orthodox churches in the region. It consists of a rectangular naos with a wooden ceiling, a rectangular sanctuary with a barrel vault, and a western tower. From the beginning, the church had eight buttresses, which were later demolished and then partially rebuilt. The door and window frames are Gothic in style. The windows, which were recently restored, were probably fewer in the beginning. Their frames are copies after a damaged original. The archaeological excavations brought to light a small amount of material, which dates between the 14th and the 19th century. Archaeologists concluded that the building might date from the end of the 14th or the beginning of the 15th century. The church was surrounded by a cemetery, but burials were also practiced inside the church, where the earliest grave securely dated contained a coin from King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary and Croatia (r. 1458&ndash;90). Several test trenches indicated the existence of another church in the village of H\u0103lmagiu, possibly built in the second half of the 15th century, and the presence of a late medieval nobiliary residence in the center of the village.<br />\r\nThe interior decoration of the church has suffered great damage, but paintings from at least three periods can be identified. The oldest wall paintings have been preserved in the sanctuary and on the triumphal arch. The inscriptions are in Church Slavonic, but the style of the paintings belongs to the International Gothic and bears similarities with a series of wall paintings in the Hungarian Kingdom dated to the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th century (e.g., Rimavsk&eacute; Brezovo, Rimavsk&aacute; Ban\u030ca, Kyjatice, R&aacute;ko&scaron;, and Chy\u017en&eacute;, all of them in Slovakia, and Nima and B\u0103de\u0219ti, in Romania).<br />\r\nThe iconographic program of the sanctuary generally obeys the Eastern canons, but at the same time adapts to the architecture of the church and reflects the Western training of the painters, who accommodated their iconographic formulas to the requirements of an Orthodox sanctuary. A large image of Christ appears on the vault, and the four Evangelists are depicted in the upper registers of the side walls. This was probably done as such because the church lacks a vault or a cupola over the naos, where these images are usually represented. Nevertheless, Christ in Glory accompanied by the Evangelists or their symbols is also an iconographic scheme that frequently decorates the vaults of the sanctuaries in many late medieval churches in the Hungarian Kingdom, and Central Europe in general. On the east wall at H\u0103lmagiu, on each side of the central window, were painted a cherub and a seraph. In the lower register, two angels probably flanked a table or a huge paten with the Christ Child on it. Five bishops, a deacon, and another saint, probably the Apostle Bartholomew, were depicted on the side walls.<br />\r\nAmong the peculiarities of the lower register is a scene situated on the south wall. It shows St. Nicholas giving a blessing to a chalice with the Christ Child in it. The figure of a falling heretic can be seen at the feet of St. Nicholas. A partially preserved inscription invokes the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It has been noted that the scene resembles the Vision of St. Peter of Alexandria, which is commonly represented in the sanctuary, in the <em>prothesis</em> or the <em>diakonikon</em> areas. St. Nicholas was also venerated as a defender of the Trinitarian doctrine, and, according to his vita, he participated in the First Council of Nicaea (325) where he also had a confrontation with Arius. A similar scene to the one at H\u0103lmagiu is found in the sanctuary of another church situated on the valley of Cri\u0219ul Alb, the church of St. Nicholas at Ribi\u021ba (Hunedoara County). Although completely different in style, the iconographic programs of the two sanctuaries are alike.<br />\r\nAnother surprising figure in the apse of H\u0103lmagiu is a saint who carries his skin and shows a knife. The inscription with his name has not been preserved. This type of representation is characteristic of the Apostle Bartholomew in Western art. It can also be seen in several medieval Catholic churches in the Hungarian Kingdom (at \u010cer&iacute;n, Kva\u010dany, &Scaron;t&iacute;tnik, and R&aacute;ko&scaron;, in Slovakia; Aba&uacute;jv&aacute;r, in Hungary; Sic, Remetea, and Media\u0219, in Romania). According to Western tradition, the Apostle Bartholomew suffered many torments and was finally beheaded. The flaying of the saint appears frequently in Latin hagiographical and liturgical sources and inspired this special iconographic type. In contrast, the flaying torture is mentioned in very few Greek sources. According to Byzantine hagiographic, liturgical, and visual sources, the common belief was that the apostle died by crucifixion. In Western religious spirituality, Bartholomew&rsquo;s flaying was a symbol of repentance and renewal in Christ. In popular belief, the saint was also a protector against various diseases, particularly those involving the skin, and patron saint of various occupations, such as tanners, furriers, shoemakers, herdsmen, agricultural workers, winegrowers, miners, and butchers. It may be assumed that certain aspects of Bartholomew&rsquo;s Latin cult, probably those related to the flaying, motivated or stimulated the adoption of the Western iconographic type in Orthodox churches. In Crete, another region of close contact between the Orthodox and the Catholic cultural spheres, St. Bartholomew was also occasionally depicted as a flayed man, holding his skin over his shoulder, and showing the knife. The literature mentions two cases: in the church of St. Pelagia at Ano Viannos, Viannos Province, Heraklion Prefecture (1360), and in the church of the Holy Apostles at Drys, Selino Province, Chania Prefecture (1382&ndash;91).<br />\r\nThe process of adoption and adaption of the Western appearance of St. Bartholomew requires further investigation. In Transylvania, a surprising twist might have happened. A figure whose appearance is identical to that of the saint at H\u0103lmagiu was represented around 1443 in the naos of the church of St. Nicholas at Densu\u0219 (Hunedoara County). According to the preserved inscription, his name is Saint Thomas. Before dismissing the inscription as a misspelling, one should consider that in the Eastern tradition there was a version of the apostle&rsquo;s apocryphal Acts called <em>Acta Thomae minora</em> or <em>Acta abbreviata</em>, which recounts that the saint was flayed alive before being pierced with spears. <em>Acta Thomae minor</em>a was apparently not a widespread text, but it has been preserved in both Greek and Slavonic languages. Therefore, it is possible that the Western appearance of St. Bartholomew was adopted for the Apostle Thomas, as it also happened in some post-Byzantine representations of St. Charalambos, a saint who was also flayed alive before his decapitation. Again, the type of representation points to the fact that the flaying and the skin had a particular significance for the believers, an issue that invites further research.<br />\r\nAt H\u0103lmagiu, fragments of a later layer of painting can be seen on the north, south, and west walls of the naos. The Dormition of the Virgin, a few scenes from the Christological cycle (the Annunciation, the Transfiguration, and the Baptism of Christ), two scenes from the Legend of St. Nicholas and two paintings showing members of the ktetor&rsquo;s family, have been partially preserved. The votive painting is situated at the west end of the north wall, opposite the south entrance to the church. Today, only the traces of St. Nicholas receiving the church from the ktetor are visible. Behind St. Nicholas there is the figure of St. George. To the east end of the north wall, two young figures, probably the children of the donor, are represented on their knees, addressing in prayer the Virgin and Child. The paintings in the naos are of unequal skill and were carried out by post-Byzantine painters, probably in the last decades of the 15th century or the first decades of the 16th century. Fragments of painting possibly dating to the 18th century can also be seen in some parts of the church, such as the <em>prothesis</em> niche and the embrasure of the middle south window.<br />\r\nBy its architecture and decoration, the church at H\u0103lmagiu is representative of the economic, social, and religious life of the Transylvanian Romanian elite at the end of the Middle Ages. Both the architecture of the church and its first decoration are rooted in Western local practices. Craftsmen of a Western training and modest artistry were probably more easily available and affordable. As their economic situation improved and the historical conditions changed, the patrons could hire painters who had good knowledge of Byzantine artistic tradition. After the middle of the 15th century, the patrons of the church of the Dormition of the Virgin afforded painters who were well trained in the Byzantine tradition and were also more numerous to the north of the Danube once the Ottomans occupied the Balkan Peninsula. Nevertheless, one can still note a certain freedom regarding the iconographic program, which was characteristic of much of the Transylvanian church decoration in the Middle Ages, probably because of a long history far from important centers of Byzantine culture. In general, the peculiar iconography of the medieval Orthodox churches in the Hungarian Kingdom raises difficulties of interpretation and suggests an intricate mix of acceptance and resistance with regard to the Western culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nC\u0103p\u0103\u021b&icirc;n\u0103, Dan. &ldquo;Cercet\u0103ri arheologice la H\u0103lmagiu \u0219i V&icirc;rfurile (jud.

    "text":"<p><em>By Cosmin Minea | New Europe College, Bucharest &amp; arthist.ro</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe early 16th-century church at Curtea de Arge\u0219 is situated on the valley of the Arge\u0219 river, in a hilly region, south of the Carpathian Mountains. This location is in the center of today&rsquo;s Romania, in northern medieval Wallachia, and close to the southern border of the former Habsburg Empire. The construction of the church started in the first year of the reign of Prince Neagoe Basarab (r. 1512&ndash;21), while Wallachia was an autonomous principality under Ottoman suzerainty. It was finished relatively quickly, in 1517, and frescoes covering the whole inside surface of the church were later painted by Dobromir Zugravul, during the reign of Radu of Afuma\u021bi (r. 1522&ndash;29).<br />\r\nThe architecture of Curtea de Arge\u0219 and its exterior decorations have drawn admiration since the earliest chronicles and traveler accounts. Its walls consist of a vertical inside layer of brick and an outside layer of stone. The monument sits on a two-meter raised platform connected to the ground by a flight of stairs at the entrance, a feature that has drawn comparisons to a mausoleum. Its nave is surrounded by three apses, the central one serving as the altar, and bearing the eastern tower, the highest, in the middle. Unusual for an Orthodox church, the narthex is larger than the nave. It is square-shaped and another smaller square is formed in the middle by twelve columns that support a second central tower and two smaller and twisting western towers. The enlarged narthex was designed to host princely graves, namely that of Neagoe Basarab, his immediate family members and successors. But it was most probably also the setting for an original religious scenography, with chairs and double-sided icons (four of them still existing) placed between the twelve columns.<br />\r\nThe most impressive part of the monument is its exterior decoration. A richly-carved middle cordon surrounds the fa&ccedil;ade and splits it into a lower and an upper sections. The lower part displays narrow windows with richly decorated stone frames, interrupted by either white or decorated marble slabs. The upper part is marked by a row of blind arcades, each containing a decorative stone disk and displaying further smaller disks each with bronze birds between them. The bird motifs were not just decorative. According to a medieval chronicler, the wind made the birds whistle and the small bells beneath them rang, creating a unique atmosphere around the exterior of the building. The cornice of the roof is marked by muqarnas-type ornaments, which are the beginning of extremely rich stone carvings, that cover the entire upper part of the church, including the roof and the four towers. The towers display the richest decorations, especially along the very thin windows, and culminating with the curved windows and window frames of the smaller towers that give them the unique, twisting impression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe possible sources for the unique architecture of the church at Curtea de Arge\u0219 are diverse and illustrate not only the thriving artistic and cultural milieu of early 16th century Wallachia but also an interrelated artistic space that stretched from Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Empire to Russia, the Caucasus and beyond to Central Asia. The ethnic origins of the builder(s) have been the subject of intense speculations that reflect specific agendas and stereotypes of the authors. The earliest commentators have noticed the similarities between Curtea de Arge\u0219 and mosques, including most obvious the succession of arches on the cornice in the Muqarnas style and the front fountain, very similar to ablution fountains found at contemporary mosques in Istanbul. Did the masons hail therefore from the Ottoman Empire, the power that also exercised political control over Wallachia?<br />\r\nRomanian scholars of the 19th and 20th centuries, who struggled to overcome the Ottoman cultural heritage and fit Curtea de Arge\u0219 into a broader Romanian history of art, strongly disagreed with this point of view. They stressed similarities with other Orthodox monuments from the region: the ground-floor plan of the church, which they classified as a triconch plan (three apses around the nave) is specific to most Wallachian churches but also to earlier Serbian medieval monuments and to monasteries on Mount Athos in Greece. The middle cordon on the fa&ccedil;ade (br&acirc;u in Romanian), is a decorative element unique in the region to several Wallachian monuments, and first appeared at the nearby Dealu Monastery (built between 1499&ndash;1501).<br />\r\nAnother popular theory, advanced by Romanian scholars, is that of Armenian or Georgian influences or builders, as seen mostly in the similar floral and geometrical motifs on the fa&ccedil;ade of Curtea de Arge\u0219. Most of the time researchers have not been specific in their visual comparisons but see as an example that I found the 10th-century Church of Holy Cross in Akdamar in today&rsquo;s Van in eastern Turkey. However, Armenian decorative motifs have long been seen as influential also for Russian medieval monuments. Among them, the late 12th-century <strong><a href=\"https://mappingeasterneurope.princeton.edu/item/the-cathedral-of-st-demetrios-vladimir.html\"><u>Cathedral of St. Demetrios in Vladimir</u></a></strong> has rich stone carvings on the fa&ccedil;ade and also general proportions that are similar to the ones of Curtea de Arge\u0219. But as shown in the contribution on this website about the Cathedral of St. Demetrios, the Russian monument has also been compared to medieval Serbian monuments, especially with Studenica Monastery. We have thus come full circle, back to the cultural milieu of the Balkans. What this brief set of visual comparisons show is that Curtea de Arge\u0219 might in fact be part of a visual culture spanning centuries and an impressive geographical distance, from Eastern Europe, the Balkans, passing through Russia, and all the way to the Caspic sea, Georgia and Armenia. The historiography of all these regions has struggled with adopting and adapting a firmly established Western conceptual apparatus, which has unfortunately obscured the complex transregional artistic relations and the overlapping or entangled natures of their artists and monuments.<br />\r\nBesides its artistic value, the church at Curtea de Arge\u0219 has a great symbolic value for Romanian culture, history, and the Orthodox Church. It is connected to the cultural and religious patronage of Prince Neagoe Basarab, hosts the remains of St. Niphon (death 1460), the first saint known to be canonization in Wallachia in 1517, and it is the setting for one of the best-known legends in Romania, that of <em>Me\u0219terul Manole</em> (Master Manole). Manole was a master mason who, the legend goes, was commissioned to build the most beautiful monastery in the land by Prince Negru Vod\u0103, the mythical founder of Wallachia. But for the building not to crumble he had to sacrifice his wife and incorporate her into the walls of the monastery. Similar stories, speaking of a great sacrifice of a master mason are to be found throughout the Balkan Peninsula, but this did not stop the legend becoming part of Romanian national folklore.<br />\r\nThe church at Curtea de Arge\u0219 has undoubtedly become the most representative monument for Romanian heritage and artistic culture in the first decades after the formation of the modern state. It has been thoroughly restored by the French architect Andr&eacute; Lecomte du No&uuml;y (1844&ndash;1914) from 1875 to 1904, when the interior frescoes were replaced with vividly-colored neo-Byzantine ones, and when a grand Episcopal Palace was constructed meters away from the church. In spite of some interventions, the architecture of the church remained largely unchanged following the restoration. The works, that involved artists and architects from France, Italy, Germany, and Romania, illustrated the desire of the new state to present the historical heritage of Romania as part of the European one. The symbol of this drive to Europeanise Romania, King Carol (r. 1866&ndash;1914), also decided to be buried, together with his wife, Queen Elisabeth (1843-1916), inside the church, and have his official portrait painted next to that of the medieval founders, on the inside walls of the building. Nowadays, a new and larger episcopal church has been built near the historical monument, where the last two kings of Romania have been buried, Carol II (1893-1953) and Michael (1921-2017).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nCernea, Emanuela, and Lucre\u021bia P\u0103tr\u0103\u0219canu, eds.&nbsp;<em>M\u0103rturii: Frescele M\u0103n\u0103stirii Arge\u0219</em><em>ului.</em> Bucharest: MNAR, 2013.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">A richly illustrated catalogue with the remaining original frescoes from Curtea de Arge\u0219 (now on display in the National Museum of Art of Romania, Bucharest), including indications of their original location&nbsp;inside the church.</p><p>L\u0103z\u0103rescu, Emil. <em>Biserica M\u0103n\u0103stirii Arge\u0219</em><em>ului</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Nikola Piperski | University of Belgrade</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Franciscan monastery of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Ba\u010d was founded around 1300 on the foundations of an older sacral building that most likely dates to the second half of the 12th century. Until the mid-15th century, it belonged to the milder, conventual current (Conventual Franciscans) of the Hungarian Franciscan Province of St. Mary, and later became a monastery of Bosnian Franciscans under the influence of St. James of the Marches (c. 1392&ndash;1476) and St. John of Capistrano (1386&ndash;1456). The monastery stood until the Battle of Moh&aacute;cs in 1526, when the Ottomans looted and burned it on their return from Buda. After the Ottoman conquest of Ba\u010d, the church was turned into a mosque, and after the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699) and the inclusion of these territories in the Habsburg monarchy, the Franciscan monastery was rebuilt. It has been in use to this day.<br />\r\nThe church of the monastery is a single-nave building, 52.05m long and 7.5m wide, with the main entrance in the west and the five-sided apse in the east end. The sanctuary and the biggest part of the nave were built from the second half of the 12th to the first half of the 14th century, being rendered in the Romanesque and early Gothic style. The massive Romanesque bell tower, erected next to the sanctuary on its southern side, is dated to around 1300. During the constructions in 18th century, the monastery received its Baroque guise. Firstly, the west fa&ccedil;ade of the church with its simple porch were reconstructed and, in the period between 1753 and 1773, the three chapels were added along the north wall of the nave, creating from the outside a mock side nave. During the span of more than 20 years (1744&ndash;68) buildings for monastic dwelling were erected next to the church, forming a cloister between their four spacious wings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe present-day church of the Franciscan monastery of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is located in the center of Ba\u010d. It is the only building that has been continuously used as a sacral building from the Middle Ages until today, not only in Ba\u010d &ndash; one of the two medieval seats of the second Hungarian Kalocsa-Ba\u010d Archdiocese, but also in the entire territory of today&#39;s northern Serbian province of Vojvodina. Based on records from the monastic chronicle, which has been kept only from the end of the 17th century, it has been traditionally interpreted that the oldest parts of this building date from the second half of the 12th century, but there are indications that it was built much earlier.<br />\r\nRight now, two phases of the construction of the Franciscan monastery of St. Mary church in Ba\u010d can be dated to the Middle Ages, before Ba\u010d fell under Ottoman rule in 1526. Based on the available material evidence, the older building layer could be dated to the second half of the 12th century, i.e. to the time around 1169, as stated in the monastic chronicle, but the possibility that it is somewhat older cannot be completely ruled out. According to the monastic chronicle it first belonged to the Order of Knights of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem. The oldest layer of frescoes also belongs to that period &ndash; the fresco of the Crucifixion of Christ on the southern buttress next to the altar apse, which was most likely created soon after the construction of the church. The earlier phase of construction should be dated to the second half of the 13th or as the very beginning of the 14th century, after the church was taken over by the Franciscans. After the church was renovated, it was painted with frescoes, the first time most likely at the beginning or in the first half of the 14th century, and the second time somewhat later, possibly around 1370. The question remains whether the church from the 12th century was built on the foundations of an older sacral building, which could be indicated by the lowest layers of the altar apse and the side walls of the choir. The greatest obstacle to solving these problems is the small number of original historical documents from the Middle Ages that refer to this church, and insufficient archaeological research of the church and the entire monastic complex.<br />\r\nThe monastery stood until 1526, when the Ottomans looted and burned it on their return from Buda. During the Ottoman campaign on Ba\u010d, the Christian population was imprisoned in the Franciscan monastery, which served as a fortress. According to some descriptions, the conquest of the monastery lasted for seven days. On the eighth day, the siege ended and the population was taken into slavery. After Ba\u010d, and subsequently the entire area of Ba\u010dka were fully conquered by the Ottomans in 1541, the church was turned into a mosque, as evidenced by a preserved mihrab on the south wall of the church nave.<br />\r\nBa\u010d was partially destroyed during the Ottoman withdrawal in 1686. The mosque was again taken over by the Franciscans from Gradovrh, from the province of Bosna Srebrna, who most likely left Bosnia in 1687 and moved to Ba\u010d together with their congregation. The reconstruction of the monastery began immediately after the arrival of the Franciscans in Ba\u010d, but it was briefly interrupted during Rakoczi&#39;s uprising. The insurgents burned the church and the monastery as well as the town of Ba\u010d in 1704, and the Franciscans fled from the Protestant insurgents to Vukovar, returning finally to Ba\u010d in 1715 when the construction and renovation of the monastery continued. The construction of the entire complex was completed in 1768. The lodgings on the left side of the church were built completely in the Baroque style, while traces of Romanesque, Gothic, Islamic, and Baroque architecture can be found in the fabric of the church.<br />\r\nThe monastic library is especially important when it comes to its movable cultural property, which holds books from the 15th to the 20th century, as well as the unpublished monastic chronicle that has been kept since the arrival of the Bosnian Franciscans in Ba\u010d. With its short summary of the events before the Franciscan arrival in Ba\u010d, the monastic chronicle is an invaluable source for the study of local history.<br />\r\nOf the large number of art objects, items for liturgical purpose, paintings of religious themes, mostly created between the end of the 17th until the end of the 19th century, one stands out - a late 17th century (1684) Italo Cretan icon of the Virgin with a Child called the Joyful Lady of Ba\u010d. This icon, painted by Greek painter Dima, was and still is highly venerated by the local Slavic population, of both Catholics and Orthodox denominations. Today, the icon is venerated not just as the Joyful Lady of Ba\u010d, but also as a Miraculous Lady of Gradovrh, protectress of the old Franciscan monastery of Gradovrh, and of the people who came with the Franciscans from Gradovrh to Ba\u010d at the end of the 17th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nCvekan, Pa&scaron;kal. <em>Franjevci u Ba\u010du&nbsp;</em>[Franciscans in Ba\u010d].

    "text":"<p><em>By Anna Adashinskaya | New Europe College, Bucharest &amp; The Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe monastery of Lesnovo, presently located in the north of the Republic of North Macedonia, near the towns of Zletovo and Probi&scaron;tip, presumably dates to the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century. One may associate its foundation with the name of St. Gabriel of Lesnovo (late 11th to 12th century), a prominent local ascetic belonging to the regional hermitic movement that encompassed also St. John of Rila, Venerable Prohor of P\u0107inja, and St. Joachim of Osogovo.<br />\r\nIn 1331, the older monastery was completely renewed by <em>sebastokrator </em>(later <em>despot</em>) Jovan Oliver (c. 1310 &ndash; after 1356), who ruled over the region. During the Church Synod in Skopje in 1347, Tsar Stefan Du&scaron;an (r. king 1331&ndash;46, tsar until 1355) established in the monastery the seat of the newly-formed diocese of Zletovo. However, with the dissolution of the Serbian state in the 1350s, the bishopric lost its importance. By 1381, the foundation became the metochion of Hilandar Monastery of Mount Athos.<br />\r\nAfter the renovation of the walls and gates in the 1330s, dedicated to the Holy Archangel Michael, the katholikon was erected between 1340/41 and 1348 on the grounds of an earlier edifice. It consists of two spatial units constructed in two stages under the patronage of the same person, Serbian aristocrat Jovan Oliver. His sponsorship is attested by three dedicatory inscriptions written in Greek and Old Church Slavonic above the door leading from the narthex to the naos and above the southern entrance to the naos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nBoth architectural divisions, the naos and the narthex, belong to the cross-in-square type, although the pillars bearing the narthex dome are adjusted to the eastern and western walls of the structure. The balance of masses in the interior and the exterior decoration of the walls and domes demonstrate an affinity with contemporary architectural projects in Thessaloniki.<br />\r\nThe system of the vertical ornamental divisions of the facades communicates the internal spatial structure of the bays. Along the eastern fa&ccedil;ade, which includes a hexagonal apse, the rhythm of vertical decoration intensifies; the wall is embellished with two superimposed layers of blind arcades supported by colonnettes. The brickwork patterns and the dynamic vertical elements that organize the exterior walls convey to the beholder the aesthetic meaning and aniconic heraldic symbolism of the building.<br />\r\nDifferent ateliers produced the murals of the naos and narthex. However, the use of Greek and Old Church Slavonic in the labels and the scenes&rsquo; inscriptions attests to the collaboration between Byzantine and Slavic masters in both artistic groups. Simultaneously, the choice of Slavonic for the first dedicatory inscription and Greek for the second one reflects the transcultural communication characteristic of the population of this border region, which passed from Byzantium to Serbia in part as a result of King Stefan Milutin&rsquo;s (r. 1282&ndash;1321) military campaigns of 1282.<br />\r\nThe painting of the naos exhibits a number of unusual iconographic solutions and rare compositions that evidence the complex theological thinking of the iconographers. For example, the decoration of the dome comprises not only the image of the Pantokrator in glory, the Heavenly Liturgy and Prophets, but also the portraits of the 40 Martyrs of Sebaste having an apotropaic character. The theme of Christ&rsquo;s priesthood dominates the decorations of the altar-space, and the program of the apse has an additional register, placed between the Communion of the Apostles and the Service of the Church Fathers, which represents Christ as an archpriest blessing the liturgical gifts situated on the altar. Another depiction of Christ holding the Gospels and wearing the patriarchal sakkos occupies the niche of the <em>diakonikon</em>.<br />\r\nThe double dedication of the church to the Holy Archangel Michael and St. Gabriel of Lesnovo resulted in the competition of the two cults. During the initial phase of the monastery&rsquo;s existence, the veneration of the hermit prevailed, but after the restoration undertaken by Jovan Oliver, the significance of the archangel&rsquo;s patronage started to increase, and, finally, replaced the ascetic cult. However, elements of monastic devotion were still preserved in the interior: St. Gabriel&rsquo;s two portraits occupy prominent places among the Church Fathers in the <em>diakonikon</em>, whereas a pseudo-arcosolium with the scene of the hermit&rsquo;s dormition is situated on the northern wall, at the entrance to the<em> prothesis</em>.<br />\r\nThe 12-scene cycle of Archangel Michael&rsquo;s miracles contains some unique compositions illustrating rare apocryphal narratives (the Fall of Satan, the Punishment of the Oath-breaker, the Healing of Monk Michael, the Miracle on the Holy Mount, etc.). A large and detailed scene of the miraculous drowning of the Arabic fleet near Constantinople celebrates the Archangel&rsquo;s protection of Christian warriors; situated right across the founder&rsquo;s portrait, it visualizes the worship of the Heavenly Archistrategos by the Serbian courtier and army commander. The ktetor&rsquo;s inscription accompanying his act of church dedication to the armed Archangel witnesses Oliver&rsquo;s progress in court dignities from <em>veliki \u010delnik</em> to <em>veliki sluga</em>, <em>vojevoda</em>, <em>sebstokrator</em>, and finally<em> despot</em>. Moreover, Oliver&rsquo;s name with the sebastokrator title inscribed in the lowest decoration zone, below the portrait, could designate the initial place for the founder&rsquo;s grave.<br />\r\nThe iconographic program of the narthex is constructed around such key topics as the divine origin of earthly authority, metaphoric illustrations of the last psalms, the humanity of Christ, and Church authority. In the dome&rsquo;s pendentives, the traditional images of the Evangelists are replaced with those of the Church Fathers at work, writing. Their wisdom forms rivers bringing water to people. In the lower zone of the murals, the ecclesiastic organization is supported by the figures of the first Zletovo bishops (John and Arsenios) and that of the monastery&rsquo;s founder, St. Gabriel.<br />\r\nOn the northern wall, the concept of power hierarchy structures the image of the founder&rsquo;s family, who is represented below the massive figures of the Serbian royal house (Tsar Stefan Du&scaron;an, Queen Jelena, and their son Uro&scaron;) receiving Christ&rsquo;s blessing. Thus, the composition visually transmits the idea of the divine origin of the tsardom and the dominance of the sovereign over his noble subjects. A similar comparison between the universal order and the state system appears in the depictions of the last psalms. Here, the cosmic symbolism of the Zodiac is juxtaposed with the harmonically-arranged social groups headed by the ruler. Finally, the Marian prefigurations of the Old Testament and the images of Christs&rsquo; ancestors (including Adam and Eve) allude to humanity&#39;s affiliation with divinity through the incarnation of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\n\u0106iri\u0107, Jasmina. &ldquo;Les embl&egrave;mes sur l&rsquo;abside de l&rsquo;&eacute;glise de Lesnovo.&rdquo; <em>Zograf</em> 35 (2011): 185&ndash;192.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">The article explores the role of codified signs and uniconic imagery on the facades of the Lesnovo <em>katholikon</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Paschalis Androudis | Aristotle University of Thessaloniki </em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nThe phiale (main water fountain) of the <em>katholikon</em> of the Great Lavra Monastery on Mount Athos, is one of the best-preserved of its kind in Byzantine monastic architecture. According to an inscription published by Gabriel Millet, it was built in 1060.<br />\r\nThe construction of the phiale is not the original Byzantine one, since it suffered alterations and restorations after the damages caused by the strong earthquakes of 1392 and 1585. The latest renovation of the phiale was undertaken in 1634, after the Ottoman authorities issued a permission for such a project.<br />\r\nIn its present octagonal form, the phiale consists of a large marble basin of Middle Byzantine fabric a bronze <em>strobilion</em> (of 13th and not of 10th-11th century as it was believed in the past) and a post-Byzantine canopy that houses the construction, with various marble slabs used as parapets in the lower zone.<br />\r\nAll the marble slabs (intact or fragmented) that were used in the construction of the phiale are spolia, of unknown provenance. Most of them are pairs with complementary decoration. Some are sculpted in the champlev&eacute; technique which is very rare on Mount Athos for this period and it can be encountered in the slabs from the marble iconostasis of Vatopedi Monastery (attributed to the end of 10th century), as well as in the lintel of the main entrance of its <em>katholikon</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nByzantine spolia as those from the phiale of the Great Lavra offer a unique glimpse into the monastery&rsquo;s long history. First they have been variously interpreted by researchers. Some tend to believe that they once formed part of the construction of the Byzantine marble iconostasis of the <em>katholikon</em>, from which only some columns stand within the central part of the sanctuary. It is noteworthy that even these columns are spolia. In 1886, they were hidden behind the construction of the new marble iconostasis of the <em>katholikon</em>. We should also bear in mind that the Byzantine iconostasis was still in situ in the 17th century when the construction of the present day phiale was accomplished.<br />\r\nThis contribution will present some further remarks and some thoughts about the possible provenance of the sculptures of the phiale. It is noteworthy that some of the slabs of the phiale, especially the three with geometric patterns are not intact, but they are cut in pieces. This remark, together with some other archaeological evidence, leads us to attribute them to the construction of an iconostasis for the <em>katholikon</em> of the Benedictine monastery of the Amalfitans.<br />\r\nThe Monastery of the Amalfitans was very active and one of the most prosperous on Mount Athos towards the end of 10th and in the next century. Its <em>katholikon </em>survives in ruins, but, judging from its size, it likely had a rich sculptural decorative program. It is therefore quite possible that the two now fragmented closure slabs of the phiale of the Great Lavra decorated once the <em>katholikon</em> of Amalfinon. After its abandonment, the slabs were cut into smaller pieces and were transferred to the Great Lavra. If this took place then this transfer likely took place after 1287 (the date of the annexation of the ruined monastery to Lavra) and certainly before 1634, which is the date of the latest restoration of the phiale.<br />\r\nThe great tower that is located on the site of the former monastery of Amalfitans is buttressed at its base, but its upper part was rebuilt in the 15th -16th century. In its upper part, the monogram of the Great Lavra is preserved, as well as many Byzantine marble fragments of capitals, cornices, lintels, and a fragmented slab with a single-headed eagle.<br />\r\nThe study of the rich sculptural material in the phiale of the Great Lavra offers various interpretations, as well as a path to the study of high-quality Byzantine sculpture of the end of the 10th century and the beginning of the 11th century on Mt Athos, with the closest parallels in the examples surviving at the monastery of Vatopedi. Such a study could also trace the afterlives of sculptures and spaces within Mount Athos in the period between the 10th and the 17th centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nAndroudis, Paschalis.&nbsp;&ldquo;Some Thoughts on the Possible Provenance of Three Middle Byzantine Champlev&eacute; Sculptures from the Phiale of the Monastery of Megisti Lavra, Mount Athos.&rdquo; In&nbsp;<em>Minimalia Medievalia</em>, edited by Fabio&nbsp;Coden, <em>Atti: Accademia Roveretana degli Agiati&nbsp;</em>8, A&nbsp;(2018): 78\u201284.</p><p>Bouras, Laskarina. &ldquo;Some Observations on the Grand Lavra Phiale at Mount Athos and its Bronze Strobilion.&quot; <em>&Delta;&epsilon;&lambda;&tau;\u03af&omicron;&nu; &tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &Chi;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&kappa;\u03ae&sigmaf; &Alpha;&rho;&chi;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&iota;&kappa;\u03ae&sigmaf; &Epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;&rho;&epsilon;\u03af&alpha;&sigmaf;&nbsp;</em>8 (1975\u20121976):&nbsp;85\u201296, pl. 44\u201251.</p><p>Pazaras, Theocharis.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Old Marble Iconostasis of the<em> katholikon </em>of the Holy Great Lavra Monastery on Mount Athos.&rdquo; In&nbsp;<em>Studies on the Byzantine Sculptures on Mount Athos </em>(in greek), edited by Theocharis Pazaras,&nbsp;33\u201252.

    "text":"<p><em>By Gabriel-Dinu Herea | National Museum of Bucovina </em><br />\r\n<em>Alice Isabella Sullivan | Tufts University </em><br />\r\n<em>Vladimir Ivanovici | University of Vienna &amp; Universit&agrave; della Svizzera italiana</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Church of the Holy Cross at P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi Monastery was built in 1487 by Prince Stephen III (r. 1457&ndash;1504), ruler of the principality of Moldavia. The small edifice consists of a triconch naos with a rounded eastern apse and two shallower lateral semicircular apses extending to the north and south. A square pronaos with a small window at the center of each of the north and south walls preceded the main liturgical space of the church. The primary entrance occupies the center of the west facade, and another small doorway leads from the pronaos into the naos, guiding the physical progression through the spaces. A shallow dome sits over the space of the pronaos, and a steeple-like dome with windows pointing in the cardinal directions rises over the central space of the naos. This modest edifice&mdash;measuring 17.6 m in length and 8.9 m on the lateral apses of the naos&mdash;likely served as the main church (<em>katholikon</em>) of a convent.<br />\r\nThe partly preserved mural cycles of the <em>katholikon</em> at P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi are rooted in Byzantine stylistic and iconographic conventions. On the exterior of the building, few images have survived. The Last Judgment takes up the entirety of the west facade, and an icon of Sts. Constantine and Helena occupies the tympanum of the main entrance. The interior murals, executed shortly after the church&rsquo;s construction in 1487 and partially repainted between 1496 and 1499, represent the earliest extant example of Moldavian monastic church painting. The sanctuary at P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi displays images of bishops and the scenes of the Last Supper, the Communion of the Apostles, and Christ Washing the Feet of the Apostles. The main image in the apse is now lost but was likely a monumental Theotokos Enthroned with the Christ Child among angels, as found in other local churches. The naos was adorned with scenes from the Passion cycle and images of military saints, as well as a votive image and the icon of Sts. Constantine and Helena. The pronaos displays an image of Christ Pantokrator in the dome above, murals of the Holy Martyrs and Pious Women, a prominent representation of the Marriage at Cana, and an image identified as the Procession of the Soldier Saints&mdash;unique in medieval or Byzantine iconography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nAs one of Stephen III&rsquo;s earliest ecclesiastical projects, the church of the Holy Cross at P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi Monastery, reveals aspects of the innovative initial stages of church architecture in Moldavia in the post-Byzantine period. In fact, the church marks the beginning of an impressive series of religious projects in Moldavia&mdash;consisting of monastic and parish churches, as well as chapels&mdash;that were designed in a new architectural vocabulary that incorporated aspects of Byzantine and Gothic church building and decorating traditions, alongside local forms. Among the extant monuments, P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi remains the key representative of Stephen&rsquo;s early churches.<br />\r\nThe church was consecrated on September 14, the Feast of the Holy Cross, and may have even been built around a relic of the True Cross present in Moldavia at the time. Although the evidence to support this hypothesis remains elusive, it is known that Stephen fostered ongoing contacts with the monastic communities on Mount Athos, providing financial assistance, initiating restoration projects, and gifting precious objects to many different monasteries on the Holy Mountain. These interactions certainly led to a growing influence of Byzantine spirituality in Moldavia.<br />\r\nAlthough the architecture and mural cycles at P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi are predominantly Byzantine in character, other facets of the liturgical space reveal adaptations of Western church-building traditions. This is markedly evident in the building technique of the church, as well as in the Gothic designs of the portals, the window frames, and the window tracery. Moreover, the sunlight effects observed in the <em>katholikon</em> at P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi reveal how the church was designed to integrate astronomical knowledge prevalent in the Latin West.<br />\r\nOn certain feast days, sunlight has been observed to fall on specific scenes and liturgical furnishings, which it unites in symbolic ways, thus underscoring theological statements. For example, the almost perfect east-west orientation of the axis of the church creates a &ldquo;light path&rdquo; around the equinoxes. Twice a year, in September and March/April, for two weeks, the light entering the church in the afternoon passes through the aligned doors of the pronaos and naos to illuminate the altar. This alignment would have corresponded with the celebration of Vespers, which centered on Christ&rsquo;s coming as Light into the darkness of the world. On the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, the first ray of sunlight that enters the church illuminates the mural of Prophet Isaiah shown standing in the cylindrical drum of the naos dome. He displays an open scroll with an inscription drawn from Psalm 112(113):3 &ldquo;From the sun&rsquo;s rising to its setting, praise the name of the Lord!&rdquo; More complex phenomena involve moving sunlight connect different sections of the building and portions of the mural decoration, underscoring their theological import and the devotional concerns of the patron. Overall, the church at P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi demonstrates how natural light reunites aspects of architecture, decoration, ritual, and theology.<br />\r\nThe architecture and decoration of the <em>katholikon</em> at P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi attest to a desire to perpetuate Christianity in its Orthodox form, but also to a willingness to rework the Byzantine legacy according to local artistic and architectural principles. The introduction of Gothic elements, as well as the echoing of contemporary political events in the iconography, at times through the invention of novel image types, strongly suggest that Stephen&rsquo;s churches, beginning with P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi, were the result of a conscious and proactive policy.<br />\r\nThis is also evident in the unique mural of the Procession of the Soldier Saints, painted in a long horizontal register on the west wall of the pronaos, above the main entrance to the church. In this non-biblical scene, Emperor Constantine and the archangel Michael front a cavalcade made up of thirteen mounted soldiers rendered in the guise of military saints. They ride toward a large cross in the sky before them, in the upper right corner of the composition. The inscription in Greek by the cross&mdash;&ldquo;In this sign [the cross] you shall defeat your enemies.&rdquo;&mdash;recalls the account of the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 in which Constantine the Great defeated Maxentius. This event marked Constantine&rsquo;s turn to Christianity and subsequent protection of the Christian faith. Fighting under the sign of the cross also resonated in the Moldavian context of the 15th century.

    "text":"<p><em>By Ivan Stevovi\u0107 | University of Belgrade</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe<em> katholikon</em> of Kaleni\u0107 Monastery is dedicated to the Presentation of the Virgin Mary. It was erected and painted around 1410. Its ktetors were <em>protovestiarios</em> Bogdan, the high court dignitary, and the Serbian Despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 (r. 1402&ndash;27).<br />\r\nBy its spatial concept, this church belongs to the contracted type of cross-in-square church surmounted by a dome, with lateral apses, and a separate narthex. The entire length of the inner space is 16.40 m, while the top of the dome is constructed at the height of 19.80 m. The exterior was carried out with particular attention: the building rests on a delicately profiled socle, while the fa&ccedil;ades were composed of regular horizontal rows of stone and bricks. The vertical profiling of the fa&ccedil;ades was achieved by constructing pilaster-strips and multileveled arched profiles, while the horizontal articulation of wall masses is dominated by two cornices. The very rich repertoire of architectural sculpture appears around windows, the front sides of arcades, and on the perforated rosettes. In the upper zone, the distinctive feature is a dynamic structure of the shape of calotte above the narthex and of the elongated volume of the dome.<br />\r\nWell preserved, the painting of Kaleni\u0107 is one of the highest quality in Morava Serbia. Its thematic repertoire consists of the representations of the Holy warriors, Church fathers, Serbian saints Sts. Simeon Nemanja and Sava, those tied to an apocryphal Life of the Virgin, as well as a composition with the representation of the ktetor&rsquo;s relatives, <em>protovestiarios </em>Bogdan and Despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 on the northern wall of the narthex. In the upper zones of the naos are the scenes of Great Feasts, as well as those from the narrative cycles of the Life and Miracles of Christ. The particularity of the program is the representation of the Dead Christ depicted inside the niche of the <em>prothesis</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nAlthough it is, without exception, regarded in historiography as the architectural accomplishment of the Serbian &ldquo;Morava School&rdquo;, the church of the Presentation of the Virgin has all the components of the late Byzantine architectural vocabulary. Such a monument is justified by the simultaneous tendency for achieving a homogenous composition of primary masses and their almost sculptural shaping by protruded volumes of conches as well as by a whole array of strikingly accentuated minor elements of the articulation of the fa&ccedil;ades. Above the lower zones rises the so-called &ldquo;fifth fa&ccedil;ade&rdquo;, the heterogeneous structure of which does not actually match the ground plan of the building.<br />\r\nSuch tendency toward&nbsp;monumental and decorative modeling of the whole structure, towards the maximal integration of individual components into the entire composition, the contrast between compact contours of the lower parts of the building and accentuated decomposition of silhouettes of the construction of domed space of the church, and the dome itself, are the extensions of those perceptions of architecture that, in the previous generation, manifested most clearly in the Panagia Parigoritissa in Arta, the Hodegetria in Mystras, and in the pareklession of the Virgin Pammakaristos in Constantinople. The details, understood as the elements that simultaneously function individually and as the organic part of the whole, represent the most important phenomena of this new architectural image, organized in such a manner as to highlight the harmony among shapes and motifs of diverse visual identity, adornment, and color.<br />\r\nIn order to be expressed to its fullest, the silhouette of the lower parts of the church, accompanied by a lavish repertoire of architectural sculpture, demanded the precise opus, visually confronted to the motif of the checkerboard in the upper zones of the conches, on the fronts of architectural elements placed below the drum, and on the drum itself. Finally, the composition of the multifaceted image of the exterior is completed by the geometrized sculptural decoration. Its strictly controlled placement is fully adjusted to the architectural forms, and its artistic function additionally accentuates the polychromy of the fa&ccedil;ades. On the exterior walls, on the contrary, colored relief on flat and concave-convex surfaces of the window jambs, arches, and rosettes, appears at the same time as an independent visual accent and an important feature in the overall intention of the master-builder of Kaleni\u0107 to dematerialize the building&rsquo;s masses. The architecture of the fa&ccedil;ades of Kaleni\u0107 is, therefore, the integral accomplishment derived from the intention to establish equal values of its inner and outer spaces and surfaces.<br />\r\nThe frescoes of <em>katholikon</em> at Kaleni\u0107 Monastery, which are of remarkable artistic qualities, have as the theme in several places the concept of ruling ideology, which is in accordance with the fact that Despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 was the second ktetor of the church. It is especially visible in the narthex, where the representation of the Flight into Egypt was depicted above the ktetors&rsquo; composition, with the personification of Egypt painted above the sovereign&rsquo;s head. Through such a visual disposition, the metaphor about the wise and book-loving ruler was accentuated, which is how Despot Stefan was otherwise represented in contemporary literary sources. Likewise, on the scene of the Census at Bethlehem, which faces the previous, enthroned Emperor Augustus was depicted as Despot&rsquo;s match and with his facial features, which is in accordance to the citations from the biography of Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 in which his genealogy has been drawn from the times of emperors Augustus and Constantine.<br />\r\nThe frescoes in Kaleni\u0107 draw a clear link between the depiction and contemporary written sources in Serbia. Although the signatures of the authors of the frescoes have not been discovered, researchers have for some time been unanimous that the painter called Radoslav, the author of the miniatures in the so-called Vissarion&#39;s Tetraevangelion, was the principal figure in the master&#39;s workshop. Finally, the function of massive stone beams, embedded into the opposite walls of the west bay, remains unresolved. According to the prevailing opinion, their function could have been tied to the exposition of Eulogiae within the space of the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nSimi\u0107 - Lazar, Draginja. &ldquo;Observations sur le rapport entre les d&eacute;cors de Kaleni\u0107, de Kahrie Djami et de Curtea de Arge\u015f.&rdquo; <em>Cahiers arch&eacute;ologiques</em> 34 (1986): 143&ndash;160.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This article offers an analysis of the iconography and iconographical relationships between the above-mentioned monuments.</p><p>Simi\u0107 - Lazar, Draginja. <em>Kaleni\u0107 et la derni&egrave;re p&eacute;riode de la peinture byzantine</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Vlada Stankovi\u0107 | University of Belgrade</em><br />\r\n<strong>Historical Overview</strong><br />\r\nThe first half of the 13th century brought about a series of radical political, social, economic, and religious changes in the Balkan Peninsula and in the wider Byzantine world. Byzantine systems of alliances through kinship were established in the last decade of the 12th century during the reign of Emperor Isaac II Angelos (r. 1185&ndash;95) with the rulers of Serbia, and Hungary to the north of the Balkans. These enabled the Byzantine Empire to secure and control the majority of its European hinterland, and to promote or strengthen its influence through shared Orthodox Christianity. The Bulgarian Empire, renewed after 1185&ndash;86, represented the only hostile rival to the Byzantine Empire in the Balkans in both political and religious terms, especially during the rule of emperor Kaloyan (r. 1197&ndash;1207). The established system collapsed with the conquest of Constantinople by the Crusaders of the Fourth Crusade in April 1204, the destruction of the empire that followed, and the overwhelming dominance of the so-called Latins. These aristocrats from western Europe, especially Flanders, Italy, and France, as well as the spiritual prevalence of the Papal authority of Innocent III (pope 1198&ndash;1216) and his successors at the helm of the Catholic Church, took control of the former Byzantine territories in the Balkans.<br />\r\nWith the Byzantine world in ruins at the onset of the 13th century, the exiled members of the vast Byzantine ruling family formed two polities: one in Asia Minor, with the center in Nicaea under Theodore I Laskaris (r. 1205&ndash;22), and the other in the Balkans, under his relative Michael Doukas Angelos (r. 1205&ndash;15). However, with the exemption of Bulgaria and the policies of the emperor Kaloyan, who recognized the authority of the pope even before the capture of Constantinople in 1204, the previously established system of kinship alliances held together, and enabled the gradual return of Byzantine influence in the Balkans, including political and spiritual dominance. Only three decades after the collapse of the empire, the Byzantines renewed kinship alliances and tied to Orthodoxy both Serbia and Bulgaria, with the recognition of the Autocephalous Archbishopric in Serbia in 1218/9 and the Autocephalous Patriarchate of Bulgaria in 1234/5 under the Bulgarian emperor John II Asen (r. 1218&ndash;41). With this reversal, the Byzantines re-established their influence in the Balkans and created a new power triangle in the region, consisting of Byzantium, Bulgaria, and Serbia, based on kinship alliances and common Orthodox faith, which will last until the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans in the 15th century.<br />\r\nA series of civil wars that shook Byzantium in the first half of the 14th century enabled the establishment of the short-lived Serbian Empire by Stefan Du&scaron;an in 1346 (r. 1331&ndash;55, emperor 1346&ndash;55), which encompassed the vast, former Byzantine territories in northern and central Greece. More importantly, however, the civil wars opened the Balkans to the Ottomans, who achieved a decisive victory on 27 September 1371 on the Ebron/Maritza river. This forced the weakened Christian states in the Balkans to pay tribute, and led to the fall of the Bulgarian Empire in 1393 and the general weakening of the Christian polities in the Balkans, especially during the rule of Sultan Bayezid I (r. 1389&ndash;1402), the son of Sultan Murat I who was killed at the battle of Kosovo in 1389. The eight decades that passed until the final fall of Constantinople and Byzantium to the hands of sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror (r. 1451&ndash;81) in 1453, witnessed the gradual but seemingly inevitable expansion of the Ottomans over the Balkans, completed by the conquests of Serbia in 1459, Peloponnesos (Byzantine Morea) in 1460, Wallachia to the north of the Danube in 1462, and Bosnia in 1463.<br />\r\nWith the conquest of Belgrade in 1521 by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent or Lawgiver (r. 1520&ndash;66), the entire formerly Byzantine and Orthodox Balkans came under the dominance of the Ottomans. But even before that, the Ottoman Empire established a new system of governance in the region, with sanjaks as the main administrative units, and &ndash; from the 16th century onward &ndash; with the organization of different religious communities (Muslim, Christian-Orthodox, and Jewish) in millets. All the members of millets, regardless of their ethnicity, enjoyed a form of autonomy, especially pertaining to judicial matters.<br />\r\nThe above-mentioned ethnic character of the ruling circles in the Ottoman Empire, similar to the previous-mentioned ethnic concept of Romanness in the Byzantine Empire, provoked incessant infighting among highly positioned servants of sultans from different ethnic groups in the first centuries of Ottoman rule in the Balkans. The Grand Viziers from Bosnia, from Serbian ethnic background, prevailed in the 16th century, and those from the Albanian ethnic background dominated in the following century. The 35th Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, of Serbian origin, instigated sultan Suleiman to restore the Patriarchate of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1557 (abandoned in 1766), favoring the Serbs over the Greeks and other Orthodox nations in the Ottoman Empire, and triggering centuries-long disputes between the Greeks, the Serbs, and the Bulgarians. A certain level of autonomy, and the diverse ethnic character of the vast Ottoman Empire, provided many opportunities for the sultans&rsquo; Christian subjects, especially in trading and other apolitical activities. But every political act of disloyalty and siding with the empire&rsquo;s Christian enemies was punished by the High Porte or the local Ottoman governors. An entire century before the activities of Rigas Pheraios and the movement for liberation of the Balkans from the Ottoman rule, the Serbs sided with the Austrian Empire in the Habsburg-Ottoman war of 1683&ndash;99, which led to their mass migration from the central Balkan regions to the plains north of the Danube (the so-called Great Exoduses of Serbs, under Patriarchs Arsenios III in 1690), forever changing the ethnic balance of these regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nHistorical studies of the Balkan Peninsula between the 13th and the 17th centuries, similar to the historical changes in the wider late- and post-Byzantine world in this period, offer various, oftentimes opposing approaches, perspectives, and conclusions, particularly regarding three key issues: a) national vs. above-national, i.e. wider perspective and approach; b) the relations of the Byzantines and the wider Byzantine world with the West, and the importance, or the lack of, religious, Orthodox identity, particularly, but not exclusively, in relations to the West; and c) the question of Byzantine identity and the understanding of the Byzantine Romanness either as an elite-promulgated, top-down construct, or as a primary identity marker of all the Byzantines, at least until late into the 15th century.<br />\r\na) The legacy of 19th-century scholarship, positivistic in approach and strictly divided along national lines, still burdens Byzantine and post-Byzantine studies, and hinders better understanding of the historical, social, cultural, artistic, religious, and economic developments of the Balkans in the late Middle Ages and beyond. The narrow focus on national histories disregards the diverse national character of the Byzantine Empire, and leaves aside close and intensive communication, cooperation, and alliances in the region in these centuries. These were never limited to narrow &lsquo;national borders&rsquo;, which in reality never existed in the modern understanding of the phrase. The tendency to generalize the history of Byzantium and the Balkans in this period, due to the limited number of sources, Byzantine and Slavic alike, led to another misunderstanding in the scholarship: unrelated events, processes, personalities from different generations and even centuries, and their actions, are uncritically and indiscriminately lumped together regardless of the concrete historical context.<br />\r\nb) The lack of modern, innovative concepts in Byzantine scholarship, evident in all the issues underscored here, hampers discussion and reevaluation of some of the basic features of Byzantium and the broader Byzantine world, and in particular of the medieval and post-medieval Balkans. The concept of a &ldquo;Byzantine Commonwealth&rdquo;, a loosely connected political alliance of different national polities based on Orthodoxy, proposed half a century ago by Dimitri Obolenski, has been mostly abandoned due to its overgeneralizing nature. The idea of &ldquo;Political Orthodoxy&rdquo;, put forward four decades ago by Hans-Georg Beck still awaits its thorough (re-)assessment. The self-evident fact of the strong Latin presence and even dominance in the Byzantine East from the 13th century onward led to exaggeration of the Byzantine-Latin cooperation, to the point of mutual assimilation, and the proposition of a common Franco-Greek culture, which existed, if at all, only in isolated pockets of Latin, and particularly Venetian dominated areas in the East. All these ideas, rather than concepts, as is the case with the previous issue, suffer from a lack of historical context and generalizations, which lead to oversimplifications of complex historical phenomena and developments. One of these is the phenomenon of Hesychasm, its spiritual and political impact in the Balkans from the 14th century onward, and the creation of a transnational Hesychast network in the region, whose members significantly influenced political, social, and cultural developments.<br />\r\nc) The self-identification of the Byzantines as Romans, and their empire as a Roman Empire, formed for a long time a bedrock of understanding of the Byzantine world and Byzantine political ideology. Until recently, this has not been seriously challenged or analyzed in greater detail. The very nature of Byzantine sources, an overwhelming majority of which emanated from the highest circle of learned men &ndash; and one woman &ndash; close to, or even members of the imperial family, placed limits to the possibility of understanding what a &lsquo;common Byzantine&rsquo; thought about himself/herself, and what emphasis, if any, was placed on the self-identification as Romans. In this aspect as well, a caution is needed, and especially the correct positioning of every single information in its adequate historical context. The collapse of the Byzantine Empire in the 13th century triggered a peculiar competition for the title of the emperor of the Romans, and witnessed the expansion of the Romans in the wider Byzantine world. For the first time in Byzantine history there was an emperor of the Romans who did not rule New Rome&ndash;Constantinople, and for a brief period of less than three years, there were actually two Byzantines crowned as emperors of the Romans: John III Batatzes in Nicaea (r. 1222&ndash;54) and Theodore Doukas Angelos in Epirus (r. 1215&ndash;30), the latter crowned in Thessaloniki in the spring of 1227 by the Archbishop of Ohrid, Demetrios Chomatenos. The ideological and political &ndash; and not ethnic &ndash; character of&nbsp;Romanness is evident from its expansion into ethnically clearly non-Roman lands: Bulgaria and Serbia. The Bulgarian emperor John II Asen (r. 1218&ndash;41) had added Romans to his imperial title after defeating Theodore Doukas Angelos in March 1230, and after becoming the overlord and protector of Mount Athos. The Serbian king and emperor Stefan Du&scaron;an similarly added Romans to his royal and later imperial title after he became the overlord and protector of Mount Athos in 1345/6. That the reaction from the Byzantine side in both cases was not hostile but rather positive and approving &ndash; at the concrete point in time, at least &ndash; shows a need for broadening research perspectives of such complex phenomena and for contextualization of every single act in order to understand its importance and meaning for contemporaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nFine, John V.

    "text":"<p><em>By Ovidiu Olar | Institute for Habsburg and Balkan Studies, Austrian Academy of Sciences</em><br />\r\n<strong>Overview</strong><br />\r\nIn 1934, Nicolae Iorga published a three-volume <em>Histoire de la vie byzantine</em> subtitled &ldquo;Empire and Civilization,&rdquo; the book represented a synthesis of decades-long research in the field. The seed had already been planted in 1907, when the Romanian historian wrote <em>The Byzantine Empire</em>. In between, Iorga had published a plethora of studies, monographs, and reviews, and had been the driving force behind the first ever International Congress of Byzantine Studies, organized in Bucharest, in 1924. On the one hand, he wanted to vindicate &ldquo;one of the greatest civilizations of the world&rdquo; against the medievalists who disrespected it and the historians who ignored it. On the other hand, he believed that the history of the Eastern Roman Empire was closely linked to the history of South-eastern European nations in general and to the history of the Romanians in particular.<br />\r\nThe first volume of <em>Histoire de la vie byzantine</em> covered the &ldquo;Ecumenical Empire&rdquo; (527&ndash;641); the second dealt with the &ldquo;Middle Empire of Hellenic Civilization&rdquo; (641&ndash;1081); the third part was dedicated to the &ldquo;Western&rdquo; invasions and their consequences (1081&ndash;1453). Iorga insisted that all volumes were based on sources and that he wanted to write an account of the &ldquo;development of Byzantine life,&rdquo; not an annotated chronology. In addition, he wanted to treat Byzantine history as part of world history.<br />\r\nTypical&nbsp;for Iorga, the &ldquo;History of the Byzantine Life&rdquo; is composed in a particular style and makes several intriguing observations, some of which triggered strong reactions. For example, Raymond Janin disagreed with the author&rsquo;s ideas about the Church and its social role. Perhaps one of the most exciting of these observations the author made on the very last pages. The fall of Constantinople under the Ottomans, states briefly the author, did not mark the end of Byzantium, because Byzantium was an idea and &ldquo;ideas survive all disasters.&rdquo;<br />\r\nTo this Byzantium, which could not and did not disappear with its capitals, Iorga dedicated a separate volume. Entitled &ldquo;Byzantium after Byzantium,&rdquo; the new monograph was &ldquo;a continuation&rdquo; of the &ldquo;History of the Byzantine Life,&rdquo; as the subtitle clearly and modestly states. It was also published in French, in Bucharest, under the aegis of the Institute for Byzantine Studies, in 1935.<br />\r\nIts foreword had been published one year before, under the same title, &ldquo;Byzantium after Byzantium.&rdquo; Iorga intended to present these &ldquo;general considerations&rdquo; at the Congress of Byzantine Studies held in Sofia in 1934. He finally boycotted the congress, in sign of disagreement with ideas expressed by the most important Bulgarian historian of the time, Pet\u0103r Mutafchiev, but turned the intended contribution into a book.<br />\r\nIorga started by presenting his definition of Byzantium. According to him, it was a &ldquo;complex of institutions,&rdquo; a &ldquo;political system,&rdquo; a &ldquo;religious formation,&rdquo; a &ldquo;type of civilization,&rdquo; which included &ldquo;the intellectual Hellenic heritage, the Roman law, the Orthodox religion,&rdquo; and all the latter&#39;s artistic consequences. Then, he explains how this Byzantium, of culture and institutions, survived for centuries, mostly in the Balkans.<br />\r\nFirst, there were the &eacute;migr&eacute;s, those who preferred exile to Ottoman rule. Many of them helped spread the knowledge of Greek, thus contributing to the intellectual and cultural development of Western Europe. Then there was &ldquo;the permanence of Byzantine forms:&rdquo; in Constantinople, the sultans acted as continuators of the emperors they had replaced, while maintaining elsewhere the local autonomies.<br />\r\nIorga further assigned a major role to the ecumenical Patriarchate, which was restored shortly after the Fall of Constantinople. However, he paired this &ldquo;Byzantium of the Church&rdquo; with a Byzantium of the &ldquo;Archons,&rdquo; the representatives of Greek families with remarkable careers in the Ottoman realm. And he connected both to the Romanian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia. Two chapters are dedicated to the &ldquo;Byzantine Imperial Idea through the Romanian Principalities&rdquo; and to the &ldquo;Romanian Princes&rsquo; Protection of the Byzantine Church and Civilization.&rdquo; Another chapter deals with the &ldquo;Renaissance through School,&rdquo; also focusing on Wallachia and Moldavia, two tributary states of the Ottomans that conserved significant prerogatives and had Christian rulers.<br />\r\nThe long 18th century dominated by the Phanariots &ndash; the Greek-speaking Orthodox elites located in Constantinople, among which were selected the grand dragomans of the Ottoman Empire and the princes of Wallachia and Moldavia &ndash; finally brought the Byzantine idea to an end. The rise of nationalistic ideas and especially the 1821 Greek Revolution marked the death of Byzantium. The &ldquo;open structure,&rdquo; which had outlived by four centuries the &ldquo;Christian imperial form,&rdquo; and by 1400 years the &ldquo;initial Roman form,&rdquo; could not resist any longer to outer and especially inner pressures.<br />\r\nAccording to Iorga, who continued his crusade for Byzantium and for Byzantine history, the feat had been impressive. As the historian himself had stated, &ldquo;Byzantium performed many miracles and especially that of lasting&rdquo; (&ldquo;Byzance fit beaucoup de miracles, mais surtout celui de durer&rdquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nAlthough it generated several reviews, mostly in international journals, <em>Byzantium after Byzantium</em> attracted rather limited attention. The first serious discussion of the ideas expressed therein dates to 1945, when Father Vitalien Laurent dedicated a splendid paper to Iorga as &ldquo;historian of Byzantine life.&rdquo; Furthermore, Iorga&rsquo;s argument was contested. According to the Romanian medievalist Petre P. Panaitescu (in Diana Mishkova&rsquo;s translation), &ldquo;The Greek culture did not penetrate the Romanian lands due to the survival of the Byzantine ideas, but due to the predominance of the rich Greeks in the cities of the Ottoman Empire.&rdquo; However, in spite of the initial reluctance and of the critical reactions, the book became a classic of Romanian historiography. Reedited in 1971 and 1992, it was translated into Romanian, Greek, and English.<br />\r\nOn the one hand, the title is particularly fortunate. Few remember the subtitle and even fewer read the 1934 &ldquo;History of the Byzantine Life,&rdquo; but many find it difficult to forget &ldquo;Byzantium after Byzantium.&rdquo; On the other hand, the title has taken over the content. Few read the book and even fewer place it in its immediate historiographical and cultural context, but many use the title as if it were self-sufficient. For example, Iorga assigns to the Ottoman Empire an important role in the survival and transmission of the imperial idea. Still, &ldquo;Byzantium after Byzantium&rdquo; is sometimes understood in plain chronological terms, as the period from 1453 to 1821. Furthermore, this reading, as a period, not as a phenomenon, is sometimes used as a tool to avoid references to the Ottoman rule in Southeast Europe.<br />\r\nIrrespective of these shortfalls, many of which seem rather imputable to the readers, than to the author, the &ldquo;Byzantium after Byzantium&rdquo; paradigm generated profitable debates and major historiographical contributions. Two of them must be mentioned. Andrei Pippidi&rsquo;s monograph on <em>The Political Byzantine Tradition in the Romanian Lands from the 16th to the 18th Century</em> (1983; 2001) contrasted ideals and realities and showed that the &ldquo;Byzantine tradition&rdquo; was not about the survival of Byzantium among the Romanians, but about Byzantine forms and aspirations in former European part of the Empire (Serbia, for example), as well as in Georgia. Daniel Barbu&rsquo;s<em> Byzance against Byzance: Explorations in Romanian Political Culture</em> (2001) took a completely different stand. Speaking about &ldquo;forms without content&rdquo; (&ldquo;forme f\u0103r\u0103 fond&rdquo;), Barbu argued that the Byzantine forms never generated a fondness in the Romanian principalities; consequently, their presence had less to do with continuity and more with Byzance against Byzance.<br />\r\nRecent projects are trying to move away from Iorga&rsquo;s &ldquo;Byzantium after Byzantium&rdquo; paradigm and focus on the repeated &ldquo;inventions&rdquo; of Byzantine tradition, as well as on discontinuities and novelties. However, no similarly fortunate paradigm is in sight. Byzantium after Byzantium has many flaws; still, as Vitalien Laurent has justly noted, it remains &ldquo;seductive.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nIorga, Nicolae. <em>The Byzantine Empire,</em>&nbsp;translated from French by Allen H.

    "text":"<p><em>By Nikolaos Mertzimekis | Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports, Ephorate of Antiquities of Chalcidice and Mount Athos</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nIn accordance with the donation policies&nbsp;of the leaders of the Danubian principalities, the Moldavian voivode Vasile Lupu (r. 1634&ndash;53) and his wife Ekaterina donated seven podeai (textile hanging below the icon) to the church of the Ascension, the <em>katholikon</em> of Golia Monastery in Moldavia (modern Romania), in 1651/2. In 1606, Golia became&nbsp;a metochion of Vatopedi Monastery on Mount Athos, and the textile eventually arrived on the Holy Mountain. The seven gold-thread podeai embroideries, together with an epitaphios and an epitrachelion, comprise a group. Today, they are kept in the sacristy of Vatopedi Monastery.<br />\r\nThese embroidered ecclesiastical heirlooms, apart from being exceptional artworks with a liturgical function and dogmatic content, constitute&nbsp;important historical sources. They include inscriptions that detail&nbsp;the names of the donors and those of the embroiderers, as well as the time and place of their production. Like the Moldavian examples, many of the gold-thread embroideries of Vatopedi eloquently &ldquo;speak&rdquo; to this day through their inscriptions about the piousness and generosity of their donors and creators, as well as of the close spiritual relations that the Athonite monastery had developed with the region of Moldavia through the help of its metochia, including Golia Monastery.<br />\r\nIn 1650, Prince Vasile Lupu&nbsp;financed the reconstruction of Golia Monastery, while&nbsp;dedicating&nbsp;to its <em>katholikon</em>&nbsp;icons, liturgical objects, vestments, and manuscripts. These donations include an epitaphios (1651&ndash;52), an epitrachelion (1651&ndash;52), and a Gospel&nbsp; Book (1648). According to their dedicatory inscriptions, Vasile Lupu donated these objects to the monastery of the Ascension, also called Golia. Together with the podeai embroideries, these examples are currently kept at Vatopedi Monastery. The archive of the monastery also preserves about&nbsp;120 documents from Vasile Lupu related to the estates of the monastery in the principality of Moldavia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThree of the Moldavian podeai at Vatopedi, produced under the patronage of Vasile Lupu,&nbsp;display a dedicatory inscription&nbsp;that reads as follows:<br />\r\n\u271a &Iota;&Omega;(&Alpha;)&Nu;(&Nu;&Eta;) &Beta;&Alpha;&Sigma;&Iota;&Lambda;&Epsilon;&Iota;&Omicron;&Upsilon; &Beta;&Omega;&Iota;&Beta;&Omega;&Nu;&Delta;&Alpha; &Epsilon;&Lambda;&Epsilon;&Omega; &Theta;(&Epsilon;)&Omicron;&Upsilon; &Pi;&Alpha;C&Eta;C &Mu;&Omicron;&Lambda;&Delta;&Omicron;&Beta;&Lambda;&Alpha;&Chi;&Iota;&Alpha;C &Kappa;(&Alpha;&Iota;) &Delta;&Omicron;&Mu;&Nu;&Alpha;C &Alpha;&Iota;&Kappa;&Alpha;&Tau;&Epsilon;&Rho;&Iota;&Nu;&Eta;C &Alpha;&Nu;&Alpha;&Theta;&Eta;&Mu;&Alpha; &Zeta;&Rho;&Xi;&#39; (1651/2)<br />\r\nTranslation: &ldquo;This&nbsp;is a gift from Ioannis Vassilios, voievoda&nbsp;of all Moldovlachia, with the help of the god and his wife Aikaterini &Zeta;&Rho;&Xi;&#39; (1651/2)&rdquo;<br />\r\nThe dedicatory inscriptions, which mention the donors and the date,&nbsp;are embroidered with gold thread. The height of the&nbsp;letters ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 cm.<br />\r\nIn analyzing the inscriptions, we must dwell on two points: The first is the title &quot;Dei Gratia&quot;, which suggests a Byzantine influence. It is a transfer of the Byzantine imperial idea of the divine origin of power, which the Moldavian leadership adopted by imitating Byzantine models. The title &quot;Dei Gratia&quot; is an expression of the independence of the Moldavian rulers toward&nbsp;the sultan, and aims to declare that the power of the ruler comes from the grace of God and does not depend on the will of the Ottomans.<br />\r\nThe compositions consisting mainly of floral decorations are achieved in&nbsp;gold and silver thread on a red velvet ground, while the surrounding frame carries floral motifs embroidered on green velvet. The use of velvet in such embroideries, and the floral motifs, are characteristic of 17th-century&nbsp;Moldavian works. Most of the textiles are embroidered with gold thread, which is tied harmoniously with the silver thread. The embroidery work highlights the varied&nbsp;vegetal motifs that reveal stylized carnations,&nbsp;tulips, lilies, and chrysanthemums, among other forms. In terms of the technique, almost all known stitches are used in these embroideries to lend complexity and visual appeal to the designs.<br />\r\nOut of the seven Moldavian podeai at Vatopedi, three carry dedicatory inscriptions.&nbsp;The three large ones range in length from 145 to 218 cm, and in width from 98 to 105 cm. The four smaller podeai are&nbsp;square in shape, and measure 115 x 115cm.<br />\r\nThe seven gold-thread embroidered podeai decorated the lower part of the despotic icons of the iconostasis and the icon stands of the <em>katholikon</em> of Vatopedi Monastery on its official feast days. These were prized possessions, executed in high-quality&nbsp;materials such as fine, well-wound gold-thread and silver-thread, especially for the vegetal decorations and the lettering of the inscriptions. The finely executed gold embroideries and the precious materials illustrate once again that in an economically thriving region with wealthy donors, such as 17th-century Moldavia, there were significant gold embroidery workshops and skilled artisans producing objects for local use and to be gifted to locales outside of the principality.<br />\r\nThe handicrafts of the Moldavian workshops, and demonstrated through the embroideries preserved at Vatopedi, attest to the continuation and development of&nbsp;gold embroidery in the centuries after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Through their donations, the Moldavian rulers and officials emerge as new&nbsp;benefactors of Vatopedi. For more than five&nbsp;centuries they have been the main donors and devotees of this monastery and the Athonite communities in general.<br />\r\nThe research and study of the rich, mostly unpublished archive and sacristy of Vatopedi Monastery will reveal the great importance of Vatopedi for the Danubian Principalities, alongside other Athonite monasteries, and will shed more light on the patrons of the monastery during the early Ottoman occupation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nMertzimekis, Nikolaos. &quot;&laquo;&hellip;&Pi;&omicron;&delta;\u03af&alpha;&iota;&sigmaf; &tau;&rho;&alpha;&nu;\u03ad&sigmaf; &delta;&iota;\u03ac &mu;&alpha;&gamma;&kappa;\u03ac&nu;&omicron;&upsilon; &epsilon;&pi;&tau;\u03ac&hellip;&raquo; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon; &eta;&gamma;&epsilon;&mu;\u03cc&nu;&alpha; &tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &Mu;&omicron;&lambda;&delta;&alpha;&beta;\u03af&alpha;&sigmaf; Vasile Lupu (1634&ndash;1653) &sigma;&tau;&eta; &mu;&omicron;&nu;\u03ae &Beta;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&pi;&epsilon;&delta;\u03af&omicron;&upsilon;.&quot;&nbsp;<em>&Delta;&epsilon;&lambda;&tau;\u03af&omicron; &tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &Chi;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&kappa;\u03ae&sigmaf; &Alpha;&rho;&chi;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&iota;&kappa;\u03ae&sigmaf; &Epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;&rho;&epsilon;\u03af&alpha;&sigmaf; </em>[Bulletin of the Christian Archaeological Society]<em>&nbsp;</em>(2013):&nbsp;349&ndash;360.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This study examines the Moldavian podeai at Vatopedi Monastery, including images of the objects and their display within the&nbsp;<em>katholikon.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This contribution was sponsored by the <a href=\"https://maryjahariscenter.org/\"><strong><u>Mary Jaharis Center for Byzantine Art and Culture</u></strong></a> at Hellenic College Holy Cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text":"<p><em>By Gregory Leighton | Uniwersytet Miko\u0142aja Kopernika w Toruniu, Toru\u0144 (NAWA-Ulam Fellow) &amp; Editorial Board Member, </em>Ordines Militares. Colloquia Torunensia Historica Historical<br />\r\n<strong>Historical Overview </strong><br />\r\nThe <em>Ordensland</em> was a theocracy ruled by the Teutonic Order, which covered the regions of present-day Poland, Lithuania, Russia (Kaliningrad oblast), Latvia, and Estonia. Spanning ca. 177,000 km2, it bordered Russia, the Baltic Sea, Rus, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Kingdom of Poland. In June of 1228, Konrad of Mazovia (d. 1247) called upon Hermann von Salza (r. 1210&ndash;1239), Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, to protect his duchy&rsquo;s borderlands against Prussian incursions. This was confirmed in three sources: The Treaty of Kruschwitz (4 June 1230), Pope Gregory IX&rsquo;s Golden Bull of Rieti (3 August 1234), and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II&rsquo;s Golden Bull of Rimini (1235). The latter codified the Order&rsquo;s power in the region, granting full control of any lands to be conquered. The Teutonic Knights were then called north, to Livonia (on the eastern shores of the Baltic sea), following the defeat of the Sword Brothers (<em>fratres milicie Christi de Livonia</em>), founded in 1201&ndash;02 on the model of the Templars, at the Battle of Saule (22 September 1236). On 12 May 1237, the Teutonic Knights absorbed the remaining members of the Sword Brothers. They were to be subject to the existing divisions of land that were laid out at the foundation of the Sword Brothers: 2/3 of the conquered lands were to go to the Bishops of Livonia, while the remaining 1/3 were to go to the brothers. The tensions between the two groups lasted until the secularization of the Livonian Branch of the Teutonic Order in 1561.<br />\r\nThe Order&rsquo;s territory increased almost immediately after they arrived in the region, with the foundation of Thorn (1231), Kulm (1232), Marienweder (1234), and other strongholds. The armies of seasonal crusaders from Germany and the Holy Roman Empire conquered lands to the north and east. An administrative structure followed, with the foundation of the Prussian bishoprics of Kulm, Pomesania, Warmia, and Sambia in 1243. There was also considerable resistance. From 1242&ndash;49 and from 1260&ndash;74, the Prussians revolted. The first uprising, led by Duke Swantopolk II of Pomerania (d. 11 January 1266) was settled by the Treaty of Christburg issued on 7 February 1249. This obligated the Prussians to accept Christianity and refurbish churches destroyed in the revolt. The second, known as the Great Prussian Uprising, occurred after the Order&rsquo;s defeat at the Battle of Durben (13 July 1260). Led by Herkus Monte, a Prussian nobleman, the fourteen-year rebellion threatened the hegemony of the Order and sparked a sustained preaching campaign throughout Europe, overseen by the Dominicans and Franciscans. Following its suppression in 1274, the remainder of the Prussian territories were systematically conquered by 1283. To the north, Livonia was formally conquered by ca. 1290.<br />\r\nFrom this point until ca. 1412, efforts were directed toward subjugating the Lithuanians. The 14th century also saw the peak of the Teutonic Order&rsquo;s administration and power, particularly under the tenure of Grand Masters, Winrich von Kniprode (1352&ndash;82) and Konrad von Jungingen (1393&ndash;1407). The Order&rsquo;s headquarters was established in 1309 at Marienburg (Malbork), named after its patron saint and reflective of the strong religious identity of its territorial lordship. Popular exports of items such as falcons, amber, honey, beer, and other goods to Europe, in addition to the import of goods and works of art from regions such as Bohemia and Italy, reflect the <em>Ordensland</em>&rsquo;s considerable trade networks and economy. Nobility from Spain, Italy, and England also came to participate in the <em>Reisen</em>: the annual campaigns against the Lithuanians. These expeditions blended the chivalric culture of contemporary knighthood with the rhetoric and framework of crusading, in addition to serving as a steady stream of financial revenue. The popularity of these expeditions also reflects the international characteristic and environment of the region.<br />\r\nIn 1386, Jogaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania, converted to Christianity, and he received baptism in the following year. These events triggered a crisis within the <em>Ordensland</em>. On 15 July 1410, the Teutonic Order, led by Ulrich von Jungingen (r. 1407-1410), was defeated at the Battle of Tannenberg by the forces of the Kingdom of Poland, mercenaries, and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The First Peace of Thorn (1 February 1411) brought about economic instability from which the region would not recover, particularly the condition of the release of hostages and payment of ransoms by the Order amounting to 100,000 Bohemian schok. The region of Samogitia, in the Lithuanian highlands, was the subject of conflict between the Order, Lithuania, and Poland throughout the 1410s and 1420s. Moreover, the Prussian cities sought independence from the Order&rsquo;s yoke, leading to the rise of the Prussian Federation in 1440. The ensuing struggle, the Thirteen Year&rsquo;s War (1454&ndash;66), was concluded by the Second Peace of Thorn (19 October 1466). The scope of the <em>Ordensland</em> had shrunk considerably, as the Kulmerland, Danzig, in addition to the castle of Marienburg, now belonged to the Kingdom of Poland. The Grand Masters were required to swear an oath of loyalty to the Polish kings. In 1525, under Albert Brandenburg of Ansbach (r. 1510&ndash;68), the Teutonic Order was secularized. Thirty-six years later, the same occurred in Livonia under Gotthard Kettler (r. 1561&ndash;87).<br />\r\nThe history of the <em>Ordensland</em> benefits from a myriad of sources produced within and outside of the Order&rsquo;s milieu. Chronicles include Peter von Dusburg&rsquo;s <em>Chronicon terre Prussie</em> (ca. 1326), and a translation of this into Middle High German by Nicolaus von Jeroschin (ca. 1331). For Livonia, there is the <em>Livl&auml;ndische Reimchronik</em> (ca. 1290), written by a member of the Order, in addition to the <em>Chronicon Lyvoniae </em>of Hermann von Wartberge (ca. 1378). Wigand von Marburg, a herald in the service of the Order, composed his chronicle of Prussia in ca. 1394. The anonymous <em>&auml;ltere Hochmeisterchronik</em> (ca. 1433&ndash;40), the <em>Geschichte von wegen eines Bundes</em> (ca. 1462), the <em>Annales seu chronici incliti regni Poloniae</em> of Jan D\u0142ugosz (ca. 1480), and smaller chronicles edited in the 5th and 6th volume of <em>Scriptores rerum Prussicarum </em>(Leipzig, 1874; Frankfurt am Mainz, 1968) document the region&rsquo;s history in the 15th and 16th century. Extensive collections of edited charters and letters, in addition to castle inventories (the so-called <em>&Auml;mterb&uuml;cher</em>) survive, providing ample evidence for the study of trade and international relations. Perhaps most importantly, there remain considerably archival materials in Berlin, Toru\u0144, and Gda\u0144sk, Tallin, Riga, St Petersburg, and Vilnius waiting for editions and publication, thus highlighting the potential of future scholarship on the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates </strong><br />\r\nThe basis for any investigation into the Teutonic Order&rsquo;s Prussian territories remains the 9-volume work of Johannes Voigt (1786&ndash;1823), Professor of History at the University of K&ouml;nigsberg and Director of the Prussian Privy State Archives, <em>Die Geschichte Preu&szlig;ens von den &auml;ltesten Zeiten bis zum Untergange der Herrschaft des Deutschen Ordens</em>. Though dated in its approaches and conclusions, it remains an excellent overview of major historical events. For Livonia, the works of Leonid Arbusow&nbsp;the Elder (1848&ndash;1912), and Leonid Arbusow the Younger (1882&ndash;1951) are critical source editions and research materials on the history of medieval Livonia.<br />\r\nThroughout the 20th century, the research was framed within the context of Ostforschung. This held the view that the German colonists of Eastern and East-Central Europe brought civilization and culture to the region, known as the <em>Kulturtr&auml;gertheorie</em>. Typical examples of this can be seen in Walther Ziesemer&rsquo;s article &ldquo;Geistiges Leben des Deutschen Ordens in Preu&szlig;en&rdquo; (1911), Kurt Forstreuter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fragen der Mission in Preu&szlig;en von 1245 bis 1260&rdquo; (1960), Erich Weise&rsquo;s &ldquo;Der Heidenkampf des Deutschen Ordens&rdquo; (1963 &amp; 1964), and the works of Fritz Gause. In the 1970s and 1980s, a greater bond between east and west was created with the institution of the<em> Ordines Militares. Colloquia Torunensia Historica </em>conference, hosted at the Nicholas Copernicus University in Toru\u0144 under the leadership of Zenon Huber Nowak, Udo Arnold, and Marian Dygo. The biennial publication of the conference proceedings continues to be one of the most exciting and comprehensive bodies of scholarly literature on the topic of the <em>Ordensland</em>, with papers available in German and English and an archive of past issues available in open access format online. At the same time, Anglophone works on the region also appeared, namely William Urban&rsquo;s <em>The Prussian Crusade</em> (1975), and Eric Christiansen&rsquo;s <em>The Northern Crusades: The Baltic and the Catholic Frontier, 1100&ndash;1525 </em>(1980). These remain classics for students today, offering broad overviews of the region written in an accessible style.<br />\r\nThe 1990s and 2000s witnessed stronger interest in the spirituality of the Teutonic Order and the religious life of the <em>Ordensland</em>, as well as the spread of the idea of crusading to the northeastern frontiers of Europe. Scholars revisited the extensive literary works of the Order and brought new interpretations forward about the inner life of the Teutonic Knights. The works of Mary Fischer, particularly her translation of Nicolaus von Jeroschin&rsquo;s <em>The Chronicle of Prussia</em> (2010) deserve special mention here, for this brought to light the rich literary catalogue of the Teutonic Order and the role of such literature in forming a communal identity among the brethren. Alan V. Murray&rsquo;s collections of studies published in 2001, 2009, and 2014, respectively, have been instrumental in highlighting the work of Eastern European scholars to a broader audience. These were <em>Crusade and Conversion on the Medieval Baltic Frontier, 1150-1500</em>, <em>The Clash of Cultures on the Medieval Baltic Frontier</em>, and <em>The North-Eastern Frontiers of Medieval Europe: The Expansion of Latin Christendom in the Baltic Lands</em>. These volumes have succeeded in increasing access to the rich field of scholarship on the Teutonic Order in Livonia and in Prussia by experts in the field.<br />\r\nEdited collections of studies have thus been instrumental in bringing to the fore and in dialogue the work of scholars working in languages such as Polish, German, Latvian, and others to a wider readership. In 2013 appeared the volume <em>Sacred Space in the State of the Teutonic Order in Prussia</em>, edited by Jaros\u0142aw Wenta and Magdalena Kopczy\u0144ska, the first work (to my knowledge) in English to tackle questions of church and sacred space in the Baltic, a region with no prior shrines to Christianity before the crusades. Two years later, Roman Czaja and Andrzej Radzymi\u0144ski&rsquo;s <em>The Teutonic Order in Livonia and Prussia: The Political and Ecclesiastical Structures, 13th-16th Century</em> was published. This work is an extremely useful handbook for students and researchers just introduced to the region who would like a fresh approach to its history, with each chapter written by leading Polish and German researchers and including useful tables of church leaders in Livonia and Prussia, Grand Masters and Officials of the Teutonic Order, maps, a concordance of placenames, and a bibliography for each entry. This trend of edited collections has been one of the main strengths in the historiography of the Teutonic Order and the medieval Baltic region. These works provide the most recent trends in research from experts whose works might normally appear primarily in German or Polish.<br />\r\nThe inner life and spirituality of the Teutonic Order is a field of interest that continues to be at the forefront of Polish, German, and more recently, English studies. A main goal of this effort has been to link the crusading movement in the Baltic to other theatres, thus removing the earlier, nationalist trends of the 20th century. Janusz Trupinda&rsquo;s 1999 study, <em>Ideologia krucjatowa w kronice Piotra z Dusburga</em> [Crusade Ideology in the Chronicle of Peter von Dusburg], contextualized Peter von Dusburg&rsquo;s text with narratives of the First Crusade. Krzysztof Kwiatkowski&rsquo;s 2012 book, <em>Zakon niemiecki jako</em> &ldquo;corporatio militaris&rdquo; [The Teutonic Order as a military corporation], offers a thorough consideration of the inner mentality of the Teutonic Order with special attention to warfare and crusading. Marcus W&uuml;st&rsquo;s <em>Studien zum Selbstverst&auml;ndnis des Deutschen Ordens im Mittelalter </em>(2013) studies the self and group image of the Teutonic Order and the manifestation of this throughout its entire literary and historical catalogue. The incorporation of the Baltic, and its reflection within this group identity, has been the subject of publications by Torben K Nielsen, Kurt Villads Jensen, and Gregory Leighton.<br />\r\nScholarly investigations and trends will only continue to grow with respect to the Teutonic Order&rsquo;s Baltic territories. Each year, more studies emerge that show how this region was a lively and integral part of the medieval world, as opposed to an outpost removed from the whole of Latin <em>Christianitas</em>. The potential for future work and scholarly collaboration in the field is limitless as more sources are made available in the form of source editions and translations, and scholars continue collaborative projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nArnold, Udo. &ldquo;Die Marienburg auf dem Weg zum Machtzentrum des Deutschen Ordens.&rdquo; In <em>Castrum sanctae Mariae.

    "text":"<p><strong>Research Project</strong> by Talia Zajac, <a href=\"https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships\"><u>Leverhulme Early Career Fellow</u></a>, John Rylands Research Institute and Library, University of Manchester<br />\r\n<strong>Website</strong>: https://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/rylands/research/projects/current/royal-women-cultural-exchanges/<br />\r\n<strong>Overview</strong><br />\r\nThis inter-disciplinary project investigates the role of royal women as bridge-builders between Byzantine Orthodoxy and Latin Christianity (modern Roman Catholicism), as political actors and as patrons of churches, monasteries, books, and objects. Combining close reading of narrative texts with analysis of charters and visual sources, it focuses on twelve representative case studies of brides in mixed Orthodox-Latin Christian marriages concluded by the ruling clan of Rus&rsquo; (medieval Belarus&rsquo;, Ukraine, and Russia) in the eleventh to thirteenth centuries. Despite accepting Christianity from Byzantium in 988/989, the ruling clan of Rus&rsquo; continued to intermarry with royal dynasties across Europe, including with the rulers of France, Germany, Scandinavia, Bohemia, Poland, and Hungary.<br />\r\nThere are two major planned scholarly outputs from this project:<br />\r\n- The first is a scholarly monograph tracing the political, patronage, and diplomatic &lsquo;bridge-building&rsquo; activities of brides such as Anna Yaroslavna (d. 1075/1079) who married King Henry I of France and, after his death in 1060, served as a co-regent for their son Philip I (d. 1108).&nbsp;<br />\r\n- The second planned output is an English translation and commentary on the texts and images in the prayer-book of Gertruda of Poland (d. 1107/8), who married the Rus&rsquo; Prince Iziaslav Yaroslavich (d. 1078). Her prayer-book (Cividale del Friuli, Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Archivi e Biblioteca, codex 136) combines Latin texts with Byzantine-style illustrations, exemplifying hybrid devotional practices that could result from ecumenical marriages concluded by the dynasty of Rus&rsquo;.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe project thus aims to examine cultural and religious exchanges between Eastern and Western Europe at royal courts facilitated by women traveling to and from Rus&rsquo; as royal brides.<br />\r\n<b>Further Reading</b><br />\r\nZajac, Talia. &ldquo;Regina Binomia: Re-Examining the Evidence for Re-Baptism and Renaming of Latin Christian Brides in Pre-Mongol Rus&rsquo;.&rdquo; <em>Byzantinoslavica: Revue internationale des &eacute;tudes byzantines</em>&nbsp;77, nos. 1-2 (2019): 264&ndash;290.&nbsp;<br />\r\nZajac, Talia. &ldquo;Remembrance and Erasure of Objects Belonging to Rus&rsquo; Princesses in Medieval Western Sources: the Cases of Anastasia Iaroslavna&rsquo;s &lsquo;Saber of Charlemagne&rsquo; and Anna Iaroslavna&rsquo;s Red Gem.&rdquo; In&nbsp;<em>Moving Women, Moving Objects (400 &ndash;1500)</em>, edited by&nbsp;Tracy Chapman Hamilton and Mariah Proctor-Tiffany, 33&ndash;58.&nbsp;Leiden: Brill, 2019.<br />\r\nZajac, Talia. &ldquo;Marriage Impediments in Canon Law and Practice: Consanguinity Regulations and the Case of Orthodox-Catholic Intermarriage in Kyivan Rus, ca. 1000&ndash;1250.&rdquo; In&nbsp;<em>Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Congress of Medieval Canon Law, Toronto, 5&ndash;11 August 2012</em>, edited by&nbsp;Joseph Goering, Stephan Dusil, and Andreas Thier, 711&ndash;729.

Berlin: De Gruyter, 2021.<br />\r\nA two-day international symposium titled &ldquo;Eclecticism at the Edges: Medieval Art and Architecture at the Crossroads of the Latin, Greek, and Slavic Cultural Spheres (ca. 1300&ndash;1550)&rdquo; (Princeton University, 5&ndash;6 April 2019) sits at the root of this publication. This volume builds upon the new worldwide interest in the global Middle Ages. It investigates the prismatic heritage and eclectic artistic production of Eastern Europe between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, while challenging the temporal and geographical parameters of the study of medieval, Byzantine, post-Byzantine, and early-modern art. Contact and interchange between primarily the Latin, Greek, and Slavic cultural spheres resulted in local assimilations of select elements that reshaped the artistic landscapes of regions of the Balkan Peninsula, the Carpathian Mountains, and further north. The specificities of each region, and, in modern times, politics and nationalistic approaches, have reinforced the tendency to treat them separately, preventing scholars from questioning whether the visual output could be considered as an expression of a shared history. The comparative and interdisciplinary framework of this volume provides a holistic view of the visual culture of these regions by addressing issues of transmission and appropriation, as well as notions of cross-cultural contact, while putting on the global map of art history the eclectic artistic production of Eastern Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Table of Contents: </strong><br />Ivan Stevovi\u0107, <em>Foreword</em><br />\r\nMaria Alessia Rossi and Alice Isabella Sullivan, <em>Introduction </em></p><p>NEGOTIATING TRADITIONS<br />Jelena Erdeljan, <em>Cross-Cultural and Transcultural Entanglement and Visual Culture in Eastern Europe, ca. 1300&ndash;1550</em><br />\r\nIda Sinkevi\u0107, Serbian Royal Mausolea: A Quest for Cultural Identity<br />\r\nDrago\u0219 Gh.

    "text":"<p><em>By Agnieszka Pata\u0142a </em>|<em> Institute of Art History, University of Wroc\u0142aw, Poland</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Parish Church of St. Elizabeth of Thuringia in Wroc\u0142aw (until 1945 Breslau) is located next to the north-western corner of the market square, on the site of an older late Romanesque hall church, erected ca. 1230&ndash;57, initially dedicated to St. Lawrence and at least since 1253 to St. Elizabeth. It is a red brick structure, with black glazed brick decorations, and stonework made of sandstone. The construction of the now existing church started ca. 1300. Abandoning the initial project of a hall church shortly afterwards, resulted in the present three aisle basilica-type body, with a high nave (29.7 m) of six bays, covered with the rib vaults, supported by the flying buttress hidden under the roofs of the side aisles, completed ca. 1340. In the next phase of construction, 1340&ndash;69, a three aisle chancel of three bays, with aisles terminating in apses at the eastern end was erected. The chancel embellished with carved keystones and consoles came into existence within one phase, created by a new group of architects and builders. No separate transept was introduced. The main altar was founded in 1361 and consecrated in 1387. The tower was finished only in 1482, and was long hailed as the tallest in the region. Two chains of 15 chapels (14 family-owned and 1 belonging to the guild of rich market traders), adjacent to the northern and southern aisles, were erected between 1380 and the second half of the 15th century. Since 1598, the roof has been covered with two-coloured tiles (green and red), which has helped distinguish the church on the city skyline.<br />\r\nIn 1525, the church was taken over by the Lutherans, and until 1945 remained the principal Protestant church in the region. Its history has seen many catastrophes (the most important in 1530, 1649, 1807, 1857, 1976), which resulted in numerous repairs, reconstructions, and neo-Gothic interventions (1890&ndash;93). However, these have not changed the essential Gothic characteristics of the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nThe church is regarded as one of the most important and representative objects in the history of medieval art and architecture in Silesia. Its monumental structure set a previously unknown measure and new standards of Gothic sacral architecture in the region. At the same time, its preserved medieval furnishings are among the most important works of Silesian Gothic art created predominantly in the workshops of Breslau-based artists, often migrants.<br />\r\nThe existence of the St. Elizabeth&rsquo;s parish (<em>parochia b. Elizabeth</em>) was first mentioned in February 26, 1253, when the right of patronage over it was granted to the order of the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star, whose members kept it until 1525. The parish comprised the area inhabited by the most affluent Breslau burghers, councillors, and the local intellectuals. This group bore the costs of the construction, maintenance, remodelling, and furnishing of the church building as well as the parish school and library through the agency of two lay administrators designated by the City Council. Therefore, St. Elizabeth&rsquo;s Church was a testament to the financial capacity, ambitions, and broad horizons of the city&rsquo;s elite. Next to St. Mary Magdalene&rsquo;s Church, it was one of the two most important parish churches of medieval and early modern Breslau, as well as an intellectual, educational, and cultural center of the city. For many years scholars have considered the church of St. Elisabeth as a copy of the Cistercian church in Zlat&aacute; Koruna. Recent research has indicated, however, the presence in the church&rsquo;s western part of forms typical of sacred architecture from the south-western regions of Germany, with particular emphasis on St. Lawrence&rsquo;s Parish Church in Nuremberg. The formal analysis of the church&rsquo;s chancel, in turn, led to conclusions about its Rhineland origin, as it bears a striking resemblance to the western part of the late 13th century church of the Canons Regular of Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune in Strasbourg (consecrated in 1320). The interiors of the Alsatian nave and the Breslau chancel are distinguished by a striking similarity in the use of slender lesenes with profiled corners.<br />\r\nA specific feature of St. Elizabeth&rsquo;s Church is the immense proportions of the nave &ndash; unusually high for brick architecture and rather uncommon in the south-western regions of Germany. The tendency for the expressive elevation of the naves was, however, noticeable earlier in Silesia and Bohemia, for example in the Cistercian church in Kamieniec Z\u0105bkowicki (Kamenz) and St. Jacob&#39;s Church in Prague. Some scholars presume that Breslau councillors intended either to compete with the monastic churches or to refer to gigantic parish churches of the Hanseatic region. Nevertheless, the body of St. Elizabeth&rsquo;s Church opened a new chapter in the history of Silesian Gothic architecture and set an obligatory benchmark for urban parish churches in Silesia for the next two centuries. The earliest example of an almost literal reference to the western part of St. Elizabeth&rsquo;s Church is the Parish Church of Sts. Peter and Paul in Legnica (Liegnitz), built beginning in 1333.<br />\r\nThe high importance of the church in medieval and early modern times is also evidenced in its furnishings, partly preserved until today. Its interior housed one of the richest collections of pre-Reformation (31) and Protestant pictorial epitaphs in this part of Europe, as well as a fair number of Gothic altarpieces (47 in the early 16th century) and early modern sepulchral monuments. The oldest elements of its furnishings still preserved in the church include the monumental (15m high) sandstone sacrament house by Jodocus Tauchen (1450s), wooden stalls and stone epitaphs commemorating, among others, Sebald Saurmann, Christoph Rindfleisch, and Ursula von Hemmerdey.<br />\r\nDuring pre-Reformation times, the interior of the church was covered with wall paintings, evident not only in traces of architectural polychromes, but also in the scene of the Last Judgment in the chapel of the von Restis family, and the recently discovered rich set of late Gothic wall-paintings from the Smedchin chapel.<br />\r\nThe most valuable artworks originating from this church, including the remnants of the retable of the main altarpiece by Hans Pleydenwurff (1462), the Polyptych of Annunciation with Unicorn, St. Hedwig&rsquo;s altarpiece, the furnishings of the family Krappe chapel, and several painted epitaphs belong now to the museum collections in Wroc\u0142aw, Warsaw, and Nuremberg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nLuchs, Hermann.<em> Die Denkm&auml;ler der St. Elisabeth-Kirche zu Breslau</em>, Breslau: Hirt, 1860.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This monograph offers a useful overview into works preserved in the church in the 19th century.

    "text":"<p><em>By Flavia Vanni </em>|<em> University of Birmingham </em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nThe Kokkini Ekklisia, also known as Panagia Vellas, was built in 1295/96 by the <em>protostrator </em>Theodoros Tzimisk&eacute;s as a main monastic church (<em>katholikon</em>). The church displays a two-columns cross-in-square plan (the columns later reinforced with pillars to secure the structure of the building), a central dome, and a dome in the narthex. The columns were of secondary use. The interior decoration included wall paintings, inlaid ceramics for the floor, and a carved wooden door. The templon and the window transennae were made of stucco. The study of the materials and workshops active in this church provides us with a snapshot of the workshops available to aristocrats such as Tzimisk&eacute;s, who moved between Epiros and Macedonia. In this picture, the stucco decoration connects the Kokkini Ekklisia and his patron to Epiros.<br />\r\nMost of this decoration survives in fragments now preserved in the sculptural collection of the church of the Parigoritissa in Arta (Epiros).<br />\r\nThe templon can be dated to the foundation of the church, as its wooden stylobate was found<em> in situ</em> below the post-Byzantine iconostasis, and no other templon was found there.<br />\r\nThe templon was free-standing and composed of knotted colonnettes, plaques, posts, and probably an epistyle. Each element was made into a formwork with at least three removable sides. Artisans poured plaster in several phases and inserted wooden pieces and reeds to reinforce the structure and provide resilience to the mixture. The formworks had decorations carved in the negative to cast the architectural element with the ornamentation; other details were later carved once the element was already dry. Finally, the pieces were also partially painted. The window transennae were made following a similar process, but during the several phases of pouring plaster, artisans inserted bull-eye glass roundels to pierce the round openings (oculi).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nPlaster reliefs, or stuccoes, were widely used to decorate Byzantine churches. Artisans used stucco for architectural decorations (e.g. stringcourse cornices, corbels, capital revetments, decorative arches and colonnettes), proskynetaria frames, window transennae (glazing), and free-standing liturgical furnishings (mainly templa). Even though stucco was used without significant interruptions from the Late Antique to the Middle and Late Byzantine periods, there is no tradition of studies concerned with this material. This is mirrored by discontinued scholars&rsquo; attempts to study this material in specific case studies. Nevertheless, recently, the studies of Papadopoulou (2001), Bouras (2012), and Vanderheyde (2020) included stucco into the broader discussion of Byzantine sculpture. Yet, stucco has been traditionally treated as an economical substitute for marble. The only survey and synthetic evaluation on stucco production in Byzantine buildings between the Middle and Late Byzantine period is the doctoral thesis of Vanni (2020). It begins to fill this gap in scholarship by discussing patterns of continuity and changes from the Late Antique period, production processes, economic implications, patronage patterns, and the importance of stucco production within the field of Mediterranean artistic production. It appears that stucco was not only a flexible and fast-working material. Its use answered specific aesthetic needs (e.g. <em>thauma, varietas</em>), continuing trends of late antique architectural decoration already described by Vitruvius (1st c. BCE), even with some typological changes.<br />\r\nThe stucco production of Late Byzantine Epiros stands out from the &lsquo;average&rsquo; stucco production recorded in other monuments, because it is composed of free-standing elements characterized by a highly specialized craftmanship. The use of free-standing stucco templa and liturgical furnishings does not find many comparisons outside Epiros, apart from late 11th-century Calabria and Sicily, and possibly Middle Byzantine Cyprus, but they differ for technical and typological aspects.<br />\r\nPetrographic analyses conducted by the Ephoreia of Arta (2001) have demonstrated that the templon and the window transennae of the Kokkini Ekklisia belonged to a broader production of stucco liturgical furnishings in Epiros identified in churches in the areas of Ioannina and Arta. They are the Kato Panagia near Arta (mid 13th century), the Taxiarches in Kostaniane (mid 13th century), the Koimesis in Petrovitsa (end of the 13th century), the Koimesis in Lyggos (end of the 13th century), and the Metamorphosis in Kleidonia (end of the 13th - beginning of the 14th century). The stucco decoration from these buildings records an almost pure-gypsum mixture with similar percentages of the minor ingredients. In all cases, the provenance of the gypsum is Epiros, thus, suggesting a local supply. These technical aspects, the use of the same decorative motifs, and the same typologies of posts and colonnettes indicate that the same workshop executed them.<br />\r\nThe stucco decoration of the Kokkini Ekklisia is crucial for interpreting this phenomenon, as it acts as a chronological indicator for the artistic production of Late Byzantine Epiros. It is the only templon with a fixed date because the original stylobate was found in situ, and here stucco was used next to other materials such as marble and wood. They show us the networking of its founder, Theodoros Tzimisk&eacute;s, with the Despot Nikephoros (r. 1267/68&ndash;96/98) and his collaborators and the open movement of artists and workshop practices between Epiros and Macedonia.<br />\r\nIt has been noted that the bricks of the Kokkini Ekklisia are the same as those in the Parigoritissa in Arta, restored by the new founder, the Despot Nikephoros (r. 1267/68&ndash;96/98). The same Kokkini Ekklisia shares architectural similarities with the Parigoritissa and the Perivleptos in Ohrid (today Sv. Kliment) (1294/5) founded by the aristocrat Progon Sgouros. The Kokkini Ekklisia also shares a team of painters with the Taxiarches of Kostaniane, founded by the <em>pansebastos</em> Isaak Theodoros. Finally, the use of stucco is another connection with the Taxiarches of Kostaniane and the Kato Panagia in Arta (possibly a despotal foundation). This exchange of materials and artisans demonstrates the easy circulation of workshops between the center of the despotal power (Arta) and its periphery. Regarding stucco, the direction of this phenomenon (center-periphery or vice-versa) has yet to be defined as the only sure chronology is the one of the Kokkini Ekklisia.<br />\r\nExcept for the Kato Panagia, all the other churches with stucco liturgical furnishings, Kokkini Ekklisia included, are in mountainous territories controlling passages between the valleys. Two of them (the Kokkini Ekklisia and the Taxiarches) still preserve the dedicatory inscriptions, which testify that the founders were collaborators of the Despot at different levels.<br />\r\nThe Kokkini Ekklisia laid on a strategic position marking the border with Thessaly, halfway on the road connecting Arta to Trikala. On the Thessalian side of the road, there was the church of the Porta Panagia at Pyle, a foundation of the half-brother of Despot Nikephoros, Ioannes I Doukas (1285). The relationships between Thessaly and Epiros fluctuated, and around 1295/96 Thessalian troops invaded several territories in southern Epiros reaching the region outside Arta. The foundation of the Kokkini Ekklisia by the <em>protrostrator </em>Theodoros Tzimisk&eacute;s, the Despot&rsquo;s closest collaborator, seems to mark the presence of the Epirote rulers in this liminal area. After all, it has been recently noted that there existed a general tendency of Despot Nikephoros and later Thomas to control the fluctuating borders of southern and western Epiros via their collaborators.<br />\r\nDue to the symbolic meaning of the Kokkini Ekklisia and its patron, the use of stucco here cannot be explained only as a &lsquo;cheap&rsquo; substitute for marble, but as an entanglement of cultural and economic factors. While Epiros did not have any marble quarries active in the Late Byzantine period, and marble supply came from centers with ancient monuments (e.g. Ambrakia-Arta), Theodoros had the means to secure two marble columns in his church. Due to its diffusion in Epirote mountainous areas, stucco may have been familiar to locals and worthy of use in such an important foundation. After all, stucco in Epiros continued to be valued even after the 13th century. A stucco post was re-used in the 18th-century fa&ccedil;ade of the Koimesis of Lyggos, a phenomenon usually encountered with reuse of marble and stone sculptures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nBouras, Charalambos, and Laskarina Boura. &Eta; &epsilon;&lambda;&lambda;&alpha;&delta;&iota;&kappa;\u03ae &nu;&alpha;&omicron;&delta;&omicron;&mu;\u03af&alpha; &kappa;&alpha;&tau;\u03ac &tau;&omicron;&nu; 12&omicron; &alpha;&iota;\u03ce&nu;&alpha;.

    "text":"<p><em>By Jakub Adamski </em>| <em>Institute of the History of Art, University of Warsaw</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe parish church in Strzegom is one of the most monumental Gothic churches built in Central Europe. The town lay in the \u015awidnica-Jawor Principality, ruled by a local branch of the Piast dynasty. From 1338, it belonged to Agnes of Habsburg (d. 1392), who received it as a dowry from her husband, Bolko II of \u015awidnica-Jawor (r. 1326&ndash;68). Strzegom belonged to the relatively small and moderately wealthy towns of Silesia. The great size of the building (its length exceeds 76 meters) and the lavishness of its sculptural decoration can only be explained by the key influence of Agnes on this construction project. The right of patronage of the parish belonged from the beginning of the 13th century to the Knights Hospitaller, but the management and financing of the construction were handled by the town council, undoubtedly supported by the duchess.<br />\r\nThe basilican church is built of granite rubble with abundant sandstone ashlar for all the architectural details. It consists of a three-bay aisled choir with three three-sided apses, a two-bay transept, and a five-bay nave, preceded by a two-tower fa&ccedil;ade. It is possible to determine the chronology of the construction by analyzing the changing architectural forms, especially the piers, the traceries, as well as the carved brackets and bosses. The aisles of the nave were built first, around 1350&ndash;70, together with two impressive portals in their middle bays. The lowest story of the north tower and most of the south arm of the transept were also built in the first phase of work. Around 1370&ndash;80, a new workshop erected the middle bay of the fa&ccedil;ade with its splendid portal, the nave clerestory (without vaults), the walls of the north transept arm, and the west piers of the crossing bay. The construction of the choir from around 1380 to 1396 was the responsibility of a third workshop, led by Master Jacob of \u015awidnica. The net vaults in the nave, transept, and chancel were not completed until the mid-15th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe church in Strzegom was one of the two most important building projects undertaken in the middle of the 14th century in the \u015awidnica-Jawor Principality; the other was a new parish church at \u015awidnica. In 1348, the war between Bohemia and Poland for the dominion over Silesia ended, as a result of which Charles IV Luxembourg (r. 1346&ndash;78) annexed this region to the Crown of the Kingdom of Bohemia. Bolko II of \u015awidnica-Jawor concluded a succession treaty, according to which his duchy was to become the property of the Luxembourgs in the event of the heirless death of the ducal couple, which happened eventually in 1392. At the same time, the conclusion of this agreement marked a period of prosperity in the Duchy of \u015awidnica and Jawor and accelerated the political career for Bolko at the Luxembourg court, of which the monumental churches in Strzegom and \u015awidnica are the most important witnesses.<br />\r\nBoth of these buildings refer in their design to the prestigious parish church of St. Elisabeth in Wroc\u0142aw. The latter church, built in its present form around 1310/20&ndash;60, set the pattern for the grand basilica that was repeated in numerous Silesian cities until the end of the Middle Ages. This grand basilica type is characterized by slender interior proportions, nave arcades with uniform molding, lesenes as the vertical articulation, and an aisled choir with three apses. This design was inspired above all by important town churches in the south-western regions of the Holy Roman Empire. Such constructions as the parish churches of Freiburg im Breisgau, Nuremberg and Nabburg simplified French interior designs of the 12th&ndash;13th centuries by abandoning the triforium, the skeletal construction of clerestory or even the cornices separating the stories of the nave walls.<br />\r\nThe church in Strzegom is one of the most monumental examples of a late-medieval &ldquo;Silesian basilica.&rdquo; It is distinguished not only by its sheer size but also by the introduction of a wide transept (probably following the example of the Collegiate Church of the Holy Cross in Wroc\u0142aw) and the use of external flying buttresses. The latter were usually hidden in the aisle attics in other Central European churches. The building has retained its original traceries. Those in the nave aisles copy the window compositions of the Holy Cross in Wroc\u0142aw and the first of Peter Parler&rsquo;s chapels in St. Vitus&rsquo;s Cathedral in Prague. The soft molding of the nave piers in Strzegom was also adopted from Bohemian buildings, this time connected with the activity of the workshop of Matthias of Arras, who started work on Prague Cathedral in 1344. In the same building phase, the Silesian church was decorated by a team of stonemasons who arrived in Silesia around 1340, probably from Vienna. This workshop, inspired by Tuscan sculpture from the circle of Giovanni and Andrea Pisano, made the figural brackets in the nave aisles and two splendid tympana of the side portals, depicting the Coronations of the Virgin Mary, Bathsheba, and Esther on the north portal, and the Dormition of the Virgin Mary on the south one. The choice of these scenes indicates Agnes of Habsburg&rsquo;s involvement in this building enterprise, as the Coronation of the Virgin Mary and Dormition are also depicted on the tympanum of the <em>Bischofstor</em> of St. Stephen&rsquo;s in Vienna, executed more or less simultaneously with the works in Strzegom. The Vienna church was the &ldquo;house church&rdquo; of the Austrian Habsburg dynasty, to which Agnes, who was brought up at the court in Vienna, belonged.<br />\r\nThese connections are even clearer in the case of the iconography of the western portal in Strzegom, which is the most magnificent work of its type in this part of Central Europe. Although its architecture is based on models from Silesia (Wroc\u0142aw) and Upper Rhineland (Strasbourg, Reutlingen, Rottweil), the two-zone tympanum with the representation of the Legend of St. Paul is a compositional variation on the tympanum of the <em>Singertor</em> of the Vienna Cathedral. Significantly, however, only the iconography was taken from there, as the western portal in Strzegom was created by sculptors connected with &ldquo;Parlerian&rdquo; workshops from southern Germany and Bohemia. The traceries of the nave clerestory and the transept piers made in the same phase of work are also a direct reference to Peter Parler&rsquo;s designs in Prague and Kol&iacute;n. It should be noted that the churches in Strzegom and \u015awidnica, although faithfully following the Silesian model of a basilican nave and an aisled choir, are the only 14th-century buildings in this region that show such a degree of dependence on prestigious Bohemian designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nAdamski, Jakub. &ldquo;B&ouml;hmische Einfl&uuml;sse in der schlesischen Kirchenbaukunst des mittleren 14.

    "text":"<p><em>By Jakub Adamski </em>| <em>Institute of the History of Art, University of Warsaw</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Collegiate Church of the Holy Cross is located on Ostr&oacute;w Tumski (Cathedral Island) in Wroc\u0142aw, the historical capital of Silesia. It occupies a square adjoining the west side of the now-lost ducal castle, founded in the 10th century by the Polish Piast dynasty. From 1202, Wroc\u0142aw and Silesia were ruled by a separate branch of this dynasty, after whose extinction in 1335 the Wroc\u0142aw principality became part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Bohemia. The collegiate church was founded in 1288 by one of the most prominent Silesian Piasts, Henry IV Probus (r. 1270&ndash;90), who thus commemorated the end of a long-lasting property dispute with the Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw, Thomas II (r. 1270&ndash;92). At that time, a canonical chapter was also established, which was forced to finance the church&rsquo;s construction following the prince&rsquo;s untimely death in 1290. This also contributed to the prolonged construction of this spectacular building project.<br />\r\nThe church is built of brick and a large amount of sandstone ashlar, from which all decorative details were made. The structure is two-storeyed and consists of an elongated four-bay choir with a three-sided termination, a transept with two-bay and three-sided closed arms, as well as a hall nave on a square ground plan. The towers were built at the western corners of the transept. The southern tower retains its original spire from 1484. The lower church, with its squat interior, bears a separate dedication to Sts. Bartholomew and Hedwig, patron saints of the Silesian Piasts. According to the founder&rsquo;s intention, this story was originally reserved for the college of mansionaries, who were to hold anniversary services for his and his ancestors&rsquo; souls. The choir of the lower church was probably completed in 1295, while the nave, divided into five bays, was built around 1330&ndash;40. The upper church, with its spacious and well-lit interior, was used by the Collegiate Chapter of the Holy Cross. The eastern part, housing the liturgical choir, was completed around 1330, while the nave, divided into three bays of unequal length, was laboriously constructed until the end of the 14th century. The vault was probably put in place around 1380.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe collegiate church of Wroc\u0142aw is one of the finest Gothic buildings of the 13th&ndash;14th centuries in Central Europe. The founder intended it to be dedicated to the glory of the Silesian house of the Piasts. This accounts for its unusual spatial arrangement and its location before the ducal castlet. The two-story structure stems from the early Christian and medieval tradition of mausoleums and palace chapels. The cruciform layout with polygonal closures of its eastern arms is a reference to St. Elisabeth&rsquo;s church in Marburg (begun in 1235), which was the sanctuary of St. Elisabeth of Hungary (niece of St. Hedwig, co-patron of the church in Wroc\u0142aw) and the necropolis of the landgraves of Thuringia. The combination of these solutions in the Wroc\u0142aw building, which has an additional centralizing layout with towers set almost in the center, is unique and speaks to the quality of both the founder and the anonymous designer.<br />\r\nThe eastern arm of the church, which is the earliest part of the building, is the first monumental example in Silesia of a long choir with a polygonal apse. The vaults of the austere lower story are based on heavy semi-octagonal supports, which originated in the architecture of Bohemia, Moravia, and Austria of the mid-13th century. The upper story of the choir, on the other hand, completely dispenses with wall articulation and instead features refined architectural details, such as the fan-shaped rib springers of an unusual form, the figural keystones, and especially the complex tracery with multiple cusps and thin moldings. Two windows in the diagonal walls of the apse are filled with triradial tracery, which gained popularity in Central Europe thanks to the cathedral lodges of Strasbourg and Cologne, while in Silesia, they appeared as early as the 1290s in the castle chapel at Racib&oacute;rz and in the Cistercian church at Lubi\u0105\u017c.<br />\r\nThe concept of erecting both stories of the church nave in a hall system must be considered original. In the lower part, a restrained yet stylistically modern type of aisle arcades was used, supported on elongated piers without capitals, whose corner moldings run uniformly into the moldings of archivolts. This solution, originating in several Central European buildings from the turn of the 14th century, became popular in Silesia thanks to the aforementioned Cistercian church at Lubi\u0105\u017c (ca. 1280&ndash;1330) and the nave of the cathedral in Wroc\u0142aw (ca. 1305&ndash;50). The original idea of the designer of the collegiate church was to articulate the piers with flat lesenes, which became popular in Silesia, most likely thanks to the influence of the church of St-Pierre-le-Jeune in Strasbourg (1300&ndash;20).<br />\r\nThe uniformly profiled arcade with added lesenes was also used in the upper story of the nave; only the cross-section of the piers was enriched through the addition of corner rolls. The most important idea of the designer of this part of the church was to introduce the use of the &ldquo;pseudo-bond&rdquo; system of the two eastern bays, consisting in the juxtaposition of the square bays of the main vessel, covered with a stellar vault, with the elongated bays of the aisles, each of which is lit by a pair of windows and supported on the outside by a double number of buttresses, supporting asymmetrical vaults, built with a combination of three triradial ribs. This solution had already been used in the eastern bay of the basilican nave of the nearby cathedral. The designer of the collegiate church doubled this arrangement of bays in the hall version, which gave the interior an unusual spaciousness resulting from the large width of the arcades and its abundant illumination. This layout of the building became a regional model for hall buildings &ndash; it was repeated in Wroc\u0142aw in the churches of the Canons Regular and Augustinians-Eremites, and outside the capital in the parish churches of Paczk&oacute;w, Namys\u0142&oacute;w, G&oacute;ra, and Lw&oacute;wek \u015alaski.<br />\r\nThe most magnificent architectural decoration of the church is its tracery windows, probably executed around 1350&ndash;60. Their curvilinear forms with abundant use of mouchettes and soufflets derive directly from the Upper Rhineland, finding their closest counterparts in the Cistercian churches at Salem, Kappel am Albis and Bebenhausen. The tracery of the west window of the nave in Wroc\u0142aw is the most advanced work of its kind in the whole of Central Europe, which was created before the beginning of Peter Parler&rsquo;s activity in Prague and Kol&iacute;n. It can be concluded that the Collegiate Church of the Holy Cross is an example of innovative stylistic changes in Gothic architecture at the turn of the 14th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nAdamski, Jakub.<em> Gotycka architektura sakralna na \u015al\u0105sku w latach 1200&ndash;1420.

    "text":"<p><em>By Nevena Bogojevi\u0107 </em>|<em> Independent Researcher</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nRudenica Monastery was built close to the homonymous village, also within easy reach of \u017eupski Aleksandrovac. The monastic church, whose original dedication remains unknown, today is dedicated to St. Elijah. The church is an endowment of nobleman Vuka&scaron;in and his wife Vukosava, whose portraits are included in the fresco program of the church. The church has a triconch plan, and belongs to the contracted type of cross&ndash;in&ndash;square church capped by a high dome, with lateral apses and nartex on the west side. The time period when the church was decorated with frescoes is uncertain, but based on recent considerations and studies, it is thought that the dating of the wall paintings could be placed in the period between 1403 and 1405.<br />\r\nThe entirety of the ktetorial composition occupies the first register of the southern wall and the southern part of the western wall of the western bay. On the south wall, the founder Vuka&scaron;in and his wife Vukosava are depicted. After the depiction of the founders, despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 (r. 1402&ndash;27) is represented on the southern part of the west wall with his brother Vuk (ca. 1380&ndash;1410). In the scene, it can be observed that the representation of the founder&#39;s church is presented by despot Stefan while he is being blessed by the divine appearing as a hand emerging from a segment of heaven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe representation of the founder&#39;s model gives the observer a view of the north side of the building. The shape of the endowment is presented in the form of a single-nave building with a dome. The dome consists of a high drum laying on a square postament, capped by a high dome. The drum contains three painted single-lobed windows. On the eastern part of the painted building, there is an altar conch with partly enhanced dimensions with a large arched opening and with a smaller one, narrower to the right side. The northern conch is painted on the same vertical axis as the dome and is lower than the eastern one. In the conch&#39;s center, an arched double-light window is depicted. The northern conch is vaulted with a semi-dome. Above the conch is a tympanum, more precisely, the northern arm of the cross, and below it is a painted line that might have the function of representing a corniche. In addition, two narrow single-light windows flank the north apse. Although the western part of the painted representation of the architecture has been damaged, a painted semi-dome is noticeable, possibly a sail vault which is thought to have existed. The facades are painted in white and ocher tones, while the roof is painted gray.<br />\r\nAlthough the representation of the ktetorial architecture within the founder&#39;s composition has often been depicted in the hands of its founder, this scene is one of the examples where the representation of the ruler received a new role, especially in the art of Moravian Serbia&#39;s period. In other words, the ruler received the role of the mediator. In the case of Rudenica&#39;s composition, despot Stefan is depicted as the mediator between Vuka&scaron;in and Christ. Therefore the representation of the church is painted in the despot&#39;s hands.<br />\r\nThrough the example of the image of the completed church from Rudenica Monastery, one could also perceive the interesting feature of parallelism. The parallelism is a representative method which is used for the image of completed endowments. Accordingly, the representation in Rudenica is on the south side of the church, and its appearance in the founder&#39;s portrait is shown on the north side. The role of the image of the church is important in the formation of the ktetorial theme. \u0422he opposite of the painted architecture, that appears also as a participant in the construction of space in the scenes of Eastern Christian fresco painting, is the image of the completed church which is independent entirely and in addition to a certain schematization, has the fundamental characteristics of the real appearance of the church. If it is observed as a body that interprets the forms of its ideal, it cannot be rejected that the representation of painted architecture in Rudenica shows the fundamental features of the real appearance of the building.<br />\r\nIf we compare the depicted representation and the northern facade of the church of St. Elijah, we can notice the evocation of the shapes of the actual building. The painted architectural elements of the church in the murals cannot be interpreted as the highest degree of its real appearance, but they can be appreciated as a visual interpretation of its basic form and the arrangement of individual elements. The concave shapes of the apses, the roof construction, the tympanum, the square postament, are depicted and imitated in the painted representation in the way that they do not provide the most realistic appearance of the building, but evoke it in a certain way. It could be observed that the number of arched window openings matches the number of openings of the northern facade. This especially comes to attention if we consider the drum of the dome. Moreover, the leaning colonette of the northern conch and the northern rosettes as decorative elements of the northern facade in the image of the completed church are omitted. The painted facade alludes to the fact that the facade of the church is plastered, and the color of the roof coverings reflects the lead material.<br />\r\nThe image of the founder with a completed church is an indispensable part of the fresco&ndash;programs in Serbian medieval art. Since the time of the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty, the painted churches within the founder&#39;s compositions were often depicted. Appeared as an important part of the ktetorial image, the representation of the churches is not just an element that plays an essential role in creating a founder&rsquo;s theme. Considering their similarity to the realistic appearance of the buildings they represent, they should also be considered as potential documents during their reconstructions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nMarinkovi\u0107, \u010cedomila. &ldquo;Slika podignute crkve: predstave arhitekture na ktitorskim portretima u srpskoj i vizantijskoj umetnosti&rdquo; [Image of the completed church: representations of architecture on founder&rsquo;s portraits in Serbian and Byzantine art].

    "text":"<p><em>By Sofija Trp\u010devski </em>| <em>Independent Researcher</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe King&#39;s Church is located in Studenica Monastery and it is dedicated to the Virgin Mary&rsquo;s parents, Sts. Joachim and Anna. Based on the founder&rsquo;s inscription, which is carved in stone and located under the roof cornice of the apse, it is known that the founder of the church was King Milutin (r. 1282&ndash;1321) and that the edifice was built in 1313&ndash;14. King&rsquo;s church was built as a single nave church with a dome. The wall paintings of the King&rsquo;s Church are one of the most beautiful examples of frescoes from the Palaiologan period, and they were painted around 1318&ndash;19. Although the painter&#39;s signature has not been preserved, based on other endowments of King Milutin and their stylistic features, it can be concluded that the same workshop, led by Michael Astrapas, was in charge of these wall paintings. The frescoes of the King&rsquo;s Church, in their proportions, scene arrangements, and composition, achieved the ideals of the Palaiologan era and represent one of the best works of Michael Astrapas and his workshop.<br />\r\nThe representation of St. George is located in the first zone of the north wall of the nave. The saint is painted next to the ancestors of King Milutin &ndash; St. Sava and St. Simeon, who are depicted next to the Virgin holding the Christ Child. St. George is depicted as a warrior; he wears armor over a blue long-sleeved tunic, and a purple cloak over it. He holds a spear in his right hand, a sword in his left, and he has a round shield strapped to his back. The figure of the holy warrior is damaged, but he is recognizable by the established iconographic features specific to representations of St. George in Serbian and Byzantine painting. Besides the iconography, the inscription next to the holy warrior is preserved confirming that this military saint is St. George.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nSt. George is one of the saints whose cult was highly respected and widespread both in Byzantium and in the territories of the Serbian state in the Middle Ages. The veneration of St. George in the Serbian lands dates back to the time of the great \u017eupan Stefan Nemanja (r. 1168&ndash;96). He is one of the first saints to be portrayed as a holy warrior in both Serbian and Byzantine art. Individual representations of this saint, as well as scenes from his life, can be found in many royal endowments of the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty. His cult was especially important to the founder of the dynasty, Stefan Nemanja, who dedicated one of his projects, the church at Djurdjeve Stupove (ca. 1175), to St. George. Following the example of the great \u017eupan, his heirs continued to revere St. George, and so the saint was depicted in a prominent place in the endowments of Nemanja&#39;s great-grandson, King Milutin.<br />\r\nBefore the 11th century, holy warriors were mostly depicted in tunics, and St. George was among the first to receive the garb of a warrior. When the cult of this saint became widespread among rulers and nobles, many chose him as the patron of their endowments, and he was depicted several times in some churches. In these representations, he was often shown as a warrior with a sword and a spear - an iconographical model transferred from Byzantine art. Depictions of warrior saints also related to the veneration of holy warriors among rulers during times of war, which is also a tradition that was transferred from Byzantium.<br />\r\nDuring the reign of King Milutin, the Serbian state significantly expanded its territories. Therefore, in the period of war, it was customary for the rulers to ask for help from the patron saint. In the case of King Milutin, who followed the model of his ancestor Stefan Nemanja, that was St. George. Therefore, it is not unusual that the individual representation of this saint was painted in the nave of the King&#39;s Church at Studenica Monastery. Moreover, this representation is also significant for its symbolic meaning and in relation to other individual figures that appear next to the saint. St. George is shown next to another holy warrior, St. Dimitrios, and on the right side next to the Serbian saints St. Sava, with the inscription: &ldquo;St. Sava The first Archbishop of all Serbian lands&rdquo; and St. Simeon, with the inscription: &ldquo;St. Simeon Nemanja.&rdquo; The two ancestors of King Milutin appear as his representatives before the Virgin and Christ, but they also emphasize that the king is a legitimate heir and part of Nemanji\u0107&#39;s holy lineage.<br />\r\nKing Milutin chose to portray St. Simeon as a representative in his endowment, which he built next to the Church of the Holy Virgin, the endowment of great \u017eupan. Also, he chose the representation of St. George, a saint who was especially respected by the great \u017eupan. St. George is depicted here in a procession with St. Simeon, who was the first Serbian ruler to dedicate his building projects to this saint, and it is known from his hagiography that he often relied on St. George during times of war. This procession, observed in relation to the founder&#39;s composition on the opposite wall, namely the south wall, conveys the idea of a ruler as a perfect warrior who achieved his military successes with the assistance of holy warriors.<br />\r\nThis kind of representation of St. George in the endowments of King Milutin was not unusual; the holy warrior was painted in the founder&#39;s composition in the church dedicated to him in Staro Nagori\u010dino (1312&ndash;13). In addition to the symbolic significance of this representation, which emphasizes King Milutin as a warrior and victor in battles with the help of St. George, it also indicates the connection of King Milutin with his ancestors, specifically Stefan Nemanja.<br />\r\nThis representation is also important because of its artistic qualities. It is part of the wall paintings accomplished by Michael Astrapas, and is an important example of fresco painting from the Palaiologan era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nBabi\u0107, Gordana. <em>The King&rsquo;s Church of Studenica, Revised and amended edition</em>, Novi Sad &ndash; Studenica Monastery, 2020.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This monograph offers a detailed study of the frescos in King&rsquo;s Church at Studenica Monastery.</p><p>Markovi\u0107, Miodrag.<em> O ikonografiji svetih ratnika u isto\u010dnohri&scaron;\u0107anskoj umetnosti i o predstavama ovih svetitelja u De\u010danima</em> (On the Iconography of the Military Saints in Eastern Christian Art and the Representations of Holy Warriors in the Monastery of De\u010dani), Zidno slikarstvo manastira De\u010dana, Beograd (1995), 567-627.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This essay focuses on the development of cults of the holy warriors and their representations throughout the Middle Ages.

It comprised several distinct regions: Greater Poland, around Gniezno, evolved on the shores of the Warta; Silesia was located along the upper course of the Odra; Lesser Poland included the lands of Krak&oacute;w and Sandomierz, on the upper Vistula; Mazovia was a region of plains on the middle course of the Vistula; and Kuyavia played the role of a buffer zone between Greater Poland and Prussia. Eastern Pomerania, which had connected Poland with the Baltic Sea in the 12th and 13th centuries, belonged to the state of the Teutonic Order since 1309. These geographically diverse lands were populated by speakers of a western Slavic language that, already in the Middle Ages, was identified as Polish.<br />\r\nPoland appeared in the historical record in the late 10th century as the land ruled by the Piasts who, starting from Greater Poland, expanded over much of the historical territory of the country. Poland became, alongside Bohemia and Hungary, an important regional power in Central Europe. Boleslaus I the Brave (r. 992&ndash;1025) and some of his successors might have been crowned in Gniezno, but the Polish royal title had ceased to be used by the end of the 11th century.<br />\r\nThe 1138 statute of succession of Duke Boleslaus III the Wry-Mouth was a turning point in the history of Poland. Boleslaus intended for each of his sons to inherit a province of the kingdom, while they would all acknowledge the leading position of the senior prince ruling in Krak&oacute;w. The seniorate system, however, resulted in constant rivalry between the ruling dukes. By 1202, the title of senior prince had been abandoned, and the kingdom of Poland had become a series of <em>de facto</em> independent principalities. The territorial integrity of the kingdom was not fully forgotten: all provinces were ruled by Piasts, and the territory corresponded to the Church province of the archbishopric of Gniezno.<br />\r\nIn Poland, the 13th century was, as was the case for the rest of East Central Europe, a period of profound transformations spearheaded by the rulers. These transformations included an influx of foreign peasants, townspeople, and Jews, mostly from the German lands; the introduction of the German law and of the law of Magdeburg in villages and towns; and the adaptation of many new technologies. These measures led to expanded woodland clearings and demographic growth, and intensified the market orientation of the economy. Regions of Poland were affected by these transformations at various levels, with Silesia being the most profoundly changed, and Mazovia the least.<br />\r\nAll attempts at reuniting the kingdom through a coronation in Krak&oacute;w or Gniezno failed to achieve lasting success until the reign of Ladislaus the Short (also called \u0141okietek, or the Elbow-High, r. 1320&ndash;33). This Piast duke of Kuyavia succeeded in bringing under his authority most of the historical territory of Poland &ndash; with the notable exceptions of Silesia and Mazovia &ndash; and was crowned in Krak&oacute;w. His successor, Casimir III the Great (r. 1333&ndash;70), consolidated the kingdom, making Krak&oacute;w his residence and seat of government. Casimir expanded the borders of the kingdom by conquering Red Ruthenia, lands that historically had belonged to Rus. Polish settlers moved in, creating a diverse society of Catholic Poles and Orthodox Rus.<br />\r\nCasimir the Great was the last Piast king of Poland. He was succeeded by his nephew, Louis of Anjou, king of Hungary, who ruled both kingdoms until his death in 1382. Louis&rsquo;s daughter Jadwiga was crowned in 1384 at the age of eleven. In 1386, Jadwiga married the grand duke of Lithuania, Jogaila, who had just been baptized in the Latin rite on time for the wedding. As Ladislaus II Jagiellon, Jadwiga&rsquo;s husband ruled as king consort until her death in 1399. From then on, and through various arrangements, the Jagiellons reigned over both Poland and Lithuania.<br />\r\nPoland and Lithuania were, in the 15th century, ruled separately. Lithuania was a partly pagan, partly Orthodox composite country that comprised the former lands of Rus and was ruled by the Lithuanian nobility. The separate rule evolved into a personal union that was formalized with the treaty of Lublin (1569), which saw the creation of the Commonwealth of the Two Nations. The Polish-Lithuanian &ldquo;republic of the nobles&rdquo; was characterized by the vast prerogatives enjoyed by the nobility. In the 15th century, the university of Krak&oacute;w had become an important centre of culture and learning in East-Central Europe. Renaissance culture flourished in the 16th century, and in the age of the Reformation and religious wars Poland was known for its unusual toleration of religious diversity.<br />\r\nLate medieval Poland was a linguistically and religiously diverse country. German was spoken in the larger cities. In 1454, responding to a petition from nobles and merchants seeking his protection, King Casimir IV took over from the Teutonic Order territories of Prussia and Eastern Pomerania that became known as Royal Prussia. These had a mostly German-speaking population and included wealthy merchant cities such as Gda\u0144sk (German: Danzig). The power of the Teutonic knights, who had suffered a crushing blow at the battle of Grunwald (German: Tannenberg; Lithuanian: \u017dalgiris), where they were defeated by a Polish-Lithuanian army, was clearly in decline. Jews are also known to have lived in Poland since the 10th century. Their numbers rose in the 13th century when Jews moved to Poland alongside German settlers, expanding the Ashkenazi world to include Poland. In contrast to the German lands and Silesia, the Jews of Poland did not experience mass expulsions in the late Middle Ages, as they remained under the protection of the king.<br />\r\nMedieval Poland&rsquo;s place on the map of East-Central Europe was truly at the crossroads of East and West. Social and cultural influences from Western Europe intensified in the 13th century in the age of migrations and great transformations. Contacts with the East Slavic and Orthodox cultural sphere, however, had grown in prominence since the mid 14th century. With the incorporation of Red Ruthenia and the union with Lithuania, Polish kings ruled over vast expanses of the former Rus lands. Oscar Halecki considered late medieval Poland-Lithuania to be a region on its own, between Germany and Muscovy.<br />\r\nThere are many and varied primary sources available for the study of medieval Poland. Charters are published primarily on a regional basis in various charter books. Chronicles, annals, saints&rsquo; lives and other narrative sources are available primarily in the <em>Monumenta Poloniae Historica</em>, a still-ongoing series of source editions published since the 19th century. The sources of medieval Poland are mostly in Latin. Texts in German are principally from urban milieus. Polish did not become a fully formed written literary language until the 16th century, when it was finally used for administrative texts such as land surveys and tax registers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nCharters and other documents make up a significant part of the primary sources available for the study of medieval Poland. Research in the auxiliary sciences of history, and especially diplomatics, is strong in Poland, resulting from widely available training in this field at Polish universities. Edition projects are regularly carried out at the Polish Academy of Sciences and various university institutes. Research projects on specific chanceries or centers of writing are also common. Polish scholarship does not, however, restrict itself to the &ldquo;practical&rdquo; aspects of reading and understanding documents and manuscripts; it has also made significant contributions to innovative approaches to the study of medieval charters and their cultural and historical significance. The role of chanceries has been the subject of many debates about the definition of this institution and its social role (see, in particular, the research of Maria Bieli\u0144ska). Stanis\u0142aw Kura\u015b and Anna Adamska have explored the literary value of the texts of charters. Polish scholars are also well-represented in research on pragmatic literacy and communication, as is attested through numerous monographs and contributions to collective volumes in the Utrecht Studies in Medieval Literacy published by Brepols.<br />\r\nThe roles and functions of rulers in the history of medieval Poland have always been, and continue to be, popular subjects of study. Key moments that have repeatedly attracted attention in research are Boleslaus the Wry-Mouth&rsquo;s 1138 statute, and the various attempts at restoring the monarchy in the 13th and early 14th centuries. More recently, Eduard M&uuml;hle has studied the place of the Piasts in medieval history and in Polish historical consciousness, while Grischa Vercamer has used a comparative approach to study the depiction of Piast rulers in Polish chronicles in a wider European perspective. Female rulers, in contrast, have attracted only limited attention. Maciej Michalski investigated the hagiography of female saints from ruling families, while Agnieszka Teterycz-Puzio studied female rulers who acted as regents of underage sons.<br />\r\nThe transformations of the 13th century have, unsurprisingly, been the subject of much discussion in scholarship on medieval Poland, as has been the case for this period in East-Central Europe more generally. In Poland, the meaning of the <em>iura ducalia</em> documented in 13th-century sources has been a particular bone of contention. Whereas scholars such as Karol Modzelewski postulated a continuity of ducal rights evolving from the 11th and the 12th centuries in an administrative structure built around castellanies, S\u0142awomir Gawlas has argued that a radical break occurred in the 13th century, as entirely new methods of administration were introduced under influence from the German lands and based on an imported territorial approach to rulership.<br />\r\nThe significance of <em>locatio</em> charters, the documents establishing the introduction of German law in villages and towns, has been the subject of abundant research, especially in the context of urbanization. Archaeological research has enabled a more holistic understanding of the process of changes that affected towns in the 13th century. The research of Marian R\u0119bkowski (for Pomerania) and Jerzy Piekalski (for Wroc\u0142aw and Krak&oacute;w) has significantly advanced the state of knowledge. It is now generally accepted that towns founded <em>a crudo radice</em>, without preceding settlement, were the exception. Most towns of the 13th century were in continuity with earlier settlements but were radically transformed in their topography and appearance in the course of the 13th century. Changes were generally not sudden but were implemented in several steps; the granting of <em>locatio</em> rights was only one aspect of this process of transformation.<br />\r\nRelations between Poland and the German lands or the Holy Roman Empire have always been of great importance in the history of medieval Poland. The role of German migrants in Poland and the building of antagonisms and stereotypes have, in particular, long been intensively scrutinized. Research from the first half of the 20th century too often tended to project modern national conceptions and prejudices onto the past and to consider national differences as primary factors in historical developments. Scholarship has, fortunately, long moved away from such conceptions. The social and cultural roles of national sentiments in medieval societies have, nonetheless, continued to be subjects of great interest. Benedykt Zientara has been interested in specifically medieval conceptions of national consciousness. S\u0142awomir Gawlas has paid closer attention to the contexts of expressions of national antagonisms and has uncovered various underlying motivations and processes. Andrzej Pleszczy\u0144ski studied the development of stereotypes in the discourse on Poland of early German writings.<br />\r\nThe origins of the Jews of medieval Poland have long been debated. Whereas it is undisputed that Jews moved to Poland in significant numbers from the German lands in the 13th century, the origins of earlier Jewish communities, and the extent of their continuity with the high and late medieval communities, are still disputed. Other subjects of particular interest are the legal statutes that regulated Jewish communities, the contribution of Jews to medieval economy, pogroms and persecutions, and the reasons for the success of the Krak&oacute;w community in the late Middle Ages.<br />\r\nThe place of Poland in the context of medieval Europe has often been studied in parallel with the history of the other two main Central European kingdoms, Bohemia and Hungary, which shared many common features in the Middle Ages. Occasionally, comparisons have been made with the evolution of the Scandinavian kingdoms. Comparative history, and the history of contacts and transfers with other parts of Europe are much rarer, but would enrich our understanding of the place of Poland in European history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nFrost, Robert. <em>The Oxford History of Poland-Lithuania, Vol. 1: The Making of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, 1385-1569</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By S&eacute;bastien Rossignol | Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador</em><br />\r\n<strong>Historical Overview</strong><br />\r\nMedieval Silesia&rsquo;s geographic location made it a zone of contact between the German lands, Poland, and Bohemia. Silesia is the region along the upper part of the Odra River, bordered by the Sudetes in the west and the Carpathians in the south, but with no clear natural boundary with Greater Poland in the north or with Lesser Poland in the east. Traditionally, Silesia has been divided between its northern part, Lower Silesia, around Wroc\u0142aw (German: Breslau; Latin: <em>Wratislavia</em>); its southern part, Upper Silesia, or the former duchy of Opole (German: Oppeln); and Moravian Silesia, around Opava (German: Troppau), which today belongs to the Czechia. In spite of the mountain ranges in the west and south, geography linked Silesia with its neighbors. The Odra connected to Brandenburg and Lusatia in the northwest, the Moravian Gate offered passage to the Czech lands, and various routes led to other regions of Poland in the north and east.<br />\r\nBetween the 11th and 17th centuries, Silesia was in turn a province of Poland, a series of independent duchies, a land of the crown of Bohemia, and part of the Habsburg monarchy. Silesia entered the historical record as a province of the kingdom of Poland, in the 11th and 12th centuries. As the Polish monarchy and the seniorate had fallen apart by the early 13th century, Silesia (Lower Silesia) and Opole (Upper Silesia) became independent duchies. In the second half of the 13th century, dynastic partitions divided both territories into ever smaller units. By the beginning of the 14th century, more than a dozen Piast dukes were ruling autonomous territories and were rivals with one another.<br />\r\nFew regions of Central Europe were as profoundly affected by the transformations of the 13th century as Silesia, especially during the reign of Duke Henry the Bearded (r. 1201&ndash;38) and his wife, Hedwig of Andechs (d. 1243). Henry the Bearded attracted settlers in the countryside and in the towns. Agriculture became more effective with new techniques and methods; urbanization intensified as towns were granted versions of German law and re-organized according to new legal, social, and topographical concepts; and the mining industry developed. According to her <em>vita</em>, Hedwig of Andechs promoted the establishment of multiple religious institutions, relying on her connections with her native southern Germany. By the end of the 13th century, Silesia was a prosperous land with a mixed population of Germans and Poles, with minorities of Jews and Francophones or Walloons.<br />\r\nSilesia broke with Poland when the Piast dukes of the region refused to join the kingdom reunited by Ladislaus the Short (r. 1320&ndash;33) in 1320. Instead, they chose, beginning in 1327, to pay homage to the king of Bohemia, John of Luxembourg (r. 1310&ndash;46). Silesia&rsquo;s contacts were re-oriented and integration with the rest of Europe was intensified. This occurred with Bohemia and, especially under Charles IV, with the German lands. The court of Prague acted as the closest political and cultural center for Silesians. Silesia provided Bohemia with a reservoir of well-educated, German-speaking young men. The Silesian dukes married women from Bohemia, the German lands, and Poland. The 14th century witnessed a long period of stability. Silesia profited from its central position at the crossroads of trade routes connecting various parts of Europe. The <em>via regia</em> had, since the early Middle Ages, connected West to East, from Central Germany to Kyiv. The Odra linked with the Baltic Sea, enabling Wroc\u0142aw to become a Hanseatic town. Through Bohemia, contacts with the Mediterranean flourished.<br />\r\nThis prosperous period came to a dramatic end in the early 15th century when the Hussite Wars broke out. Emperor Sigismund, elected king of Bohemia but unable to reside in Prague, moved his court to Wroc\u0142aw. Silesian society overwhelmingly opposed the religious reformers and the region was devastated by the incursions of Hussite troops. The second part of the 15th century was a period of economic and social reconstruction for the region. Landlords restricted the rights of peasants and built their centralized authority through the intensification of demesne lordship. The mining industry was revitalized. Municipal authorities gained accrued independence, which allowed them, beginning with Wroc\u0142aw in 1454, to expel Jews for good.<br />\r\nPolitical insecurity reigned in the later part of the 15th century. The Utraquist king George of Pod\u011bbrady (r. 1458&ndash;71) fueled controversy, and after his death, the rule over Silesia became a bone of contention between Bohemia and Hungary. Ferdinand of Habsburg, Archduke of Austria (1521&ndash;64) and future emperor (1556&ndash;64), was able to seize control of Silesia in the turmoil that followed the Hungarian defeat against the Ottomans at Moh&aacute;cs in 1526. Silesia remained part of the Habsburg monarchy until it again became the subject of conflicts, this time with Prussia, on the eve of the Seven Years&rsquo; War.<br />\r\nHumanist culture reached Silesia in the late 15th century, and the Protestant Reformation in the early 16th. Although plans to establish a university failed, Wroc\u0142aw became a center of humanist culture. In contrast to Hussitism, the 16th-century Reformation found fertile ground in Silesia. The region did not become Lutheran at a specific date, but reform ideas gained acceptance without a radical break with Rome. It was not until the Council of Trent that the Silesian Church was forced to clarify that its moderate approach to reform meant, in the end, that it could not be considered Catholic.<br />\r\nWritten sources for Silesia in the 11th and 12th centuries are rare, and the Silesian society of that period is mostly known through the progress of archaeological research. Many of the written sources available for medieval Silesia have been published in the several volumes of the <em>Codex diplomaticus Silesiae</em>. Chronicles began to be written in Latin in the later 13th century. A few urban chronicles are dated to the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Literary sources include <em>Die Kreuzfahrt des Landgrafen Ludwig von Th&uuml;ringen</em>, which was written at the court of the duke of Opava in the early 14th century, and various texts of the late 15th century, such as the so-called <em>Wiener Osterspiel</em>, named after the location of its manuscript but written in the Silesian-German dialect. The most abundant sources, however, beginning in the 13th century, are the charters produced by the chanceries of the ducal courts and religious institutions. Charters were first written in Latin, and increasingly in German during the 14th century. Czech documents appeared in some parts of Silesia in the late 15th century. The 14th century also saw the emergence of law books with normative texts and various registers recording legal affairs, especially property transactions. Legal scholars also wrote numerous commentaries and handbooks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nThe historiography of medieval Silesia cannot be approached without consideration of the history of the region in the 20th century. Before 1945, Silesia (<em>Schlesien</em>) was a province of Germany with a predominantly German-speaking population. In 1945, Silesia (\u015al\u0105sk) became part of Poland; the vast majority of the German-speaking population resettled in various parts of Western and Eastern Germany, while Polish citizens moved in, many of them coming from areas of eastern Poland, such as the region of Lw&oacute;w (now Lviv; in German, Lemberg), which had become part of Ukraine and thus of the Soviet Union. The scholars of the German-language University of Breslau also left, and teaching and research resumed in Polish at the University of Wroc\u0142aw. Postwar study of the history of medieval and early modern Silesia has thus been pursued by Polish scholars who had access to the holdings of Silesian archives and libraries, and by scholars from Germany who considered the history of Silesia to also be part of German history. Polish and German are still the two main languages of scholarly publication for the history of Silesia, and it would be impossible to study it without the ability to read both. Cooperation between Polish and German scholars has improved over time and has intensified since the 1990s. It is still rare for scholars from other countries to undertake research on Silesia.<br />\r\nThe migration of mostly German settlers in the 13th century, and the consequences of that migration, have long been an area of research interest in the history of Silesia. Walter Kuhn, who moved from Breslau to Hamburg after 1945, published numerous detailed studies between the 1950s and 1970s, recording the migration of German settlers in various parts of Silesia. These studies remain valuable for their thorough documentation. More recent research has been devoted to the migration of specific groups: Benedykt Zientara reviewed the evidence concerning Walloons, Marek Cetwi\u0144ski and Tomasz Jurek investigated the migration of German knights, and Ulrich Schmilewski studied the effects of migration on the Silesian nobility. Attention has also been given to the modes of integration of the migrants (Piotr G&oacute;recki; Josef Joachim Menzel).<br />\r\nThe complex political history of the region and of its diverse populations has spurred numerous investigations into the constructions of collective identities for the region. In seminal articles, Tomasz Jurek and Halina Manikowska reviewed the various understandings of the region&rsquo;s name in medieval sources. More recently, Stanis\u0142aw Rosik and Przemys\u0142aw Wiszewski dedicated cooperative projects to the study of the historical identities of Silesia (Rosik) and to an inquiry into social and cultural cohesion in the Middle Ages (Wiszewski). S&eacute;bastien Rossignol has also written about regional identity as reflected in ducal charters.<br />\r\nCharters and related documents have been the subject of very important research. Publication of the six volumes of the <em>Schlesisches Urkundenbuch</em>, which comprise all known documents produced in Silesia until 1300, has been completed by Winfried Irgang. Regesta of documents available in Silesian archives have been compiled for the 14th and 15th centuries. Foundational studies of various chanceries have been completed by scholars of the University of Wroc\u0142aw, such as Ro\u015bcis\u0142aw \u017berelik, Marek L. W&oacute;jcik, and others. Research has focused heavily, however, on the 13th century, a period for which there are fewer documents available, which makes systematic research more manageable. Much remains to be done for the later centuries, when the number of documents produced expanded dramatically. An important pioneering work in that regard has been the publication by Tomasz Jurek of the <em>Landb&uuml;cher</em>, or register books, of the duchy of \u015awidnica (German: Schweidnitz) of the late 14th century, during the rule of Duchess Agnes.<br />\r\nAnother subject that has long attracted scholarly attention is urbanization. Immense progress has been made in understanding medieval urbanization through advances in archaeology. Jerzy Piekalski, in particular, conducted excavations and studies of various aspects of urban material culture as well as syntheses and comparative studies of the transformation of urban topography in the 12th and 13th centuries. Mateusz Goli\u0144ski used tax records of the late 14th century for numerous studies of the socio-topography of medieval towns, and published various primary sources. Numerous local studies on the history of specific Silesian towns have also been published.<br />\r\nThe history of Jews in medieval Silesia is an important area of research. Markus Brann&rsquo;s book, published in 1896, still provides a useful introduction. Although many specific aspects of his research have been revised, the book remains the most approachable and comprehensive overview. More recently, several scholars, including Mateusz Goli\u0144ski, have studied various aspects of the life of Jews in Silesian towns. Marcin Wodzi\u0144ski published an edition &ndash; with abundant commentary &ndash; and Polish translations of Hebrew inscriptions from medieval and early modern Silesia, thus providing an invaluable tool for research. Rural history, by contrast, has been largely neglected in postwar Silesia. Richard C. Hoffmann&rsquo;s study of rural developments of the duchy of Wroc\u0142aw from the 13th to the 15th century is as impressive in its scope and detailed analysis as it is unique. More recently, Krzysztof Fokt reviewed archaeological evidence of rural settlements in medieval Lower Silesia.<br />\r\nResearch on medieval Silesia still favors the 12th and 13th centuries, a period of dynamic transformations and integration into the broader European world. The long period of stability during the 14th century, and the crises of the 15th century, which tend to attract less attention, have much to offer to scholars interested in exploring unpublished documents and manuscripts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nG&oacute;recki, Piotr. <em>A Local Society in Transition: The Henryk&oacute;w Book and Related Documents</em>, Studies and Texts 155.

    "text":"<p><em>By Jasmina S. \u0106iri\u0107 | University of Kragujevac</em><br />\r\n<strong>Overview</strong><br />\r\nMay 3, 2021 marked twenty years since the devastating damages caused in 2001 on the <strong><a href=\"https://mappingeasterneurope.princeton.edu/item/the-church-of-the-dormition-of-the-mother-of-god.html\">Church of the Most Holy Mother of God in Matei\u010d</a></strong>, in the historical area of \u017degligovo in the Republic of North Macedonia. The monastery holds within eight centuries of religious life and the community dedicated to God. \u017degligovo Monastery or Matei\u010d Monastery belongs administratively to the Municipality of Lipkovo. The name Matei\u010d derives from the word mother (in Serbian &ldquo;Mati&rdquo;) - Mother of God. The fact that God and nature richly endowed this area is additionally confirmed by the lush vegetation, spring water, and seemingly untouched nature. However, such an image of idyllic paysage is disturbed by the ruins firstly seen on the road leading toward the monastery.<br />\r\nThe monastery became known as an imperial endowment dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin in the heart of the Nemanji\u0107&rsquo;s dynasty <em>terra sacra</em>. It is important to mention that Matei\u010d is listed in the Charter (Chrysobull) of King Stefan Uro&scaron; II Milutin (r. 1282&ndash;1321) issued for St. George monastery near Skoplje. According to the biography of Emperor Uro&scaron; V, written by Patriarch Pajsij\u0435, Emperor Stefan Du&scaron;an (r. 1355&ndash;71) started the construction of the Church of the Assumption in its place, and the church was completed around 1357 by Empress Jelena with her son Uro&scaron; V around 1357.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nDuring the 15th century, Matei\u010d was a marvelous center of culture. Isaija Srbin, a famous hymnographer who wrote the famous hymn &ldquo;Polijelej Servikos&rdquo;, lived in this monastery. From November 21, 1456, to November 11, 1457, Vladislav Gramatik compiled a &quot;Collection&quot; of liturgical texts in Mlado Nagori\u010dino. In 1479, he prepared another &quot;Collection&quot; which is kept today in Rila Monastery in Bulgaria. After the arrival of the Ottomans, the monastery suffered from numerous devastations. The removal of the roof during the 18th century, which was secondarily used to cover the Eski mosque in Kumanovo, was very damaging for the church.<br />\r\nAfter the Balkan wars, the Matei\u010d and Kumanovo regions belonged to the Kingdom of Serbia. This occasion provided an excellent opportunity for researchers to get in touch with all the forgotten Nemanji\u0107 endowments on this territory. The architectural features and monumental painting of Matei\u010d were examined for the first time by Nikolaj Okunjev, Svetozar Radoj\u010di\u0107, Radoslav Gruji\u0107, \u0110ur\u0111e Bo&scaron;kovi\u0107. An important source about the restoration of the church was noted in the text &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"http://digitalna.nb.rs/wb/NBS/novine/vreme/1926/11/01#page/0/mode/1up\">King and Queen in the Mateji\u0107 Monastery</a></strong>&rdquo;&#39; published in the journal<em> Vreme</em> on November 1, 1926. The article mentions that H.R.H. Knight King Alexander I Karadjordjevic, H.R.H. Queen Marija, and Prince Arsen, visited Matei\u010d Monastery, and on that occasion, recorded the names of all citizens who lived around the monastery. In 1934, under the auspices of H.R.H King Alexander I Karadjordjevi\u0107, Matei\u010d monastery was finally restored. The project temporarily stopped further damages to the frescoes. After the Second World War, restoration works were carried out in the church, which lasted almost until 1960. Unfortunately, after the dispute from 1967 (the conflict between the Serbian Orthodox Church canonically recognized by Ecumenical Patriarch and the Macedonian Orthodox Church), the monastery was left to merciless destruction as well as unfavorable political circumstances.<br />\r\nThe endowment of Empress Jelena Nemanji\u0107 and Uro&scaron; IV, the Monastery of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the village of Matei\u010d, was turned into a terrorist headquarters and arsenal storage site on May 3, 2001, during the conflicts between regular government military police forces in Skopje and paramilitary groups of Albanian extremists. During the armed conflicts, the monastery residence, which served as a children&#39;s resort decades earlier, was bombed. Parts of the church were seriously devastated: the frescoes and the floor in the altar area were damaged when the plaque of the altar was destroyed. Broken doors, windows, and the damaged roof, west facade, and dome increased the dampness in the building destroying the frescoes. Remains of water-sediment are still evident in the narthex, the doors on the west and south sides were demolished; even insect colonies found their permanent habitat in the altar area. The original transparent glass from the central dome was permanently damaged. One small particle of the original medieval glass from Matej\u010de church is still kept between the archival documents from the legacy of the architect \u0110ur\u0111e Bo&scaron;kovi\u0107 in Belgrade.<br />\r\nIt should be mentioned that on the eve of St. Vitus feast in 2001, His Holiness the Archbishop of Pe\u0107 Metropolitan of Belgrade and Karlovci, Serbian Patriarch Pavle sent <strong><a href=\"http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2001/08/12/srpski/D01081105.shtml\">a letter</a> </strong>to Kofi Annan (UN Secretary-General) and Koitsiru Matsuri (UNESCO Secretary-General) on the occasion of the serious destructions of the Serbian monasteries in Kosovo and Metohija and Skopska Crna Gora. His Holiness Patriarch Pavle stressed that Matei\u010d Monastery is a monument in particular danger: &ldquo;There is a danger that in the confrontation between the Macedonian army and terrorist forces, this great Orthodox shrine will be mined from the inside or bombed from the outside.&rdquo; George Robertson (Secretary-General of NATO) with gratitude for addressing His Holiness explained that: &ldquo;NATO finds the importance of the cultural heritage and religious centers of all European cultures and will continue to support monuments in Kosovo.&rdquo; Mr. Peter Feith visited Matei\u010d in mid-July 2001. The village was heavily destroyed.<br />\r\nAlbanian extremists from the Ushtria &Ccedil;lirimtare Komb&euml;tare (U&Ccedil;K - National Liberation Army) used dynamite, bombs, mines, and tanks. All known circumstances were mentioned in the official <strong><a href=\"http://www.icomos.org/risk/2001/mace2001.htm\">Report to ICOMOS</a></strong> in September 2001. The Minister of Culture (Ms. Samoilovska-Cvetanova) appealed to the UNESCO Secretary-General regarding the problems of cultural heritage in Macedonia during the conflict. In June 2001, the ICOMOS Executive Board in Macedonia decided to launch a campaign to save the cultural heritage threatened by the armed conflict. It was suggested that the president of ICOMOS, Mr. Michael Petzet, be asked to appeal for the salvation of the monastery in Matei\u010d as one of &quot;the most valuable examples of Byzantine architecture and fresco painting of the 14th century.&quot;<br />\r\nRestoration of the suspected damage was financially supported by the Dutch Embassy in Skopje joined by the staff of the EU Monitoring Mission. It was recommended that Macedonian and international experts should undertake restorations. During the mission, it became apparent that the frescoes had suffered numerous devastations. Most of all, the church was demolished and damages were apparent at numerous frescoes (e.g. the Virgin Mary with Christ, the fresco of St. Apostle Peter with sprayed graffiti &ldquo;Dgego Armando Maradona; Kupa Uefa&rdquo; and sprayed double-headed eagle with U&Ccedil;K abbreviation inside).<br />\r\nFor the official report (July 6-7, 2001) regarding the situation in Matei\u010d monastery, one of the team members photographed the condition of the frescoes, which clearly showed graffiti, as well as various inscriptions depicting the Holy Apostle Peter. These photos were taken by Joris D. Kila, who also published a book on heritage in danger and used the photo from Matei\u010d on the cover of his study.<br />\r\nDespite the cleaning of the frescoes, which were partially saved by the National Conservation Center of the Republic of North Macedonia, it is still possible to see the remains of black and green spray used by the terrorists on several frescoes.<br />\r\nSince 2001, Matei\u010d Monastery has been the most endangered cultural heritage site in the Republic of North Macedonia. Despite all the misfortunes, the church still defies time and its believers do not forget it at least on the day of the Assumption. For the last 17 years, every September 21, dozens of believers (former residents of the village of Matei\u010d and citizens from Kumanovo) come to celebrate the feast. However, they are awaited by broken doors and windows, destroyed frescoes, excavated floors, and humidity due to the damages of the roof structure.<br />\r\nEarlier this year, the office of Ms. Irena Stefoska, the Minister of Culture of the Republic of North Macedonia, announced that one million Macedonian denars had been allocated from the funds intended for immovable cultural heritage for preventive interventions in architecture and painting of the church in Matei\u010d, which should be implemented by the <strong><a href=\"http://kultura.gov.mk/stefoska-bucetot-za-kulturata-vo-20201-e-realen-prilagoden-na-okolnostite-i-proektiran-spored-kovid-uslovite/\">National Conservation Center in Skopje</a></strong>. Twenty years after the conflicts caused by the Albanian paramilitary National Liberation Army, there is hope that the long period of negligence will stop and that the dignity of the Monastery of the Most Holy Mother of God in Matei\u010d, the remarkable work of its founders, will be properly restored.<br />\r\nWith this situation in mind, it is necessary to place Matei\u010d Monastery on the endangered list since this monument represents an outstanding example of a type of building, architectural and technological ensemble, that illustrates a significant stage of Serbian medieval history and visual identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\n\u010calija, J. &ldquo;Manastir Matei\u010d svedok vekova i nemara.&rdquo; <em>Politika</em>. 6.6.2021.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">This is the interview given by the author of the entry for &quot;Politika&quot; the oldest daily newspaper still in circulation in the Balkans and is considered to be one of Serbia&#39;s newspapers of record.

    "text":"<p><em>By Octavian-Adrian Negoi\u021b\u0103 | Institute for the History of Religions, Romanian Academy </em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nSituated on a hill on the right bank of the D&acirc;mbovi\u021ba River in Bucharest, Radu Vod\u0103 Monastery is one of the most renowned monastic establishments within the Romanian Patriarchate. Dating to the mid-16th century (1568), the monastery experienced multiple stages of development in its complex history.<br />\r\nThe church follows the triconch plan of the episcopal church of Curtea de Arge\u0219, built between 1515 and 1517 by the ruler Neagoe Basarab, with the difference that the construction material used for the Radu Vod\u0103 Monastery was brick and not stone. Whereas the naos presents a steeple-like dome supported on four arches, the expanded narthex is roofed by three smaller domes, the middle one being also supported by four arches that rest on twelve columns signifying the twelve apostles. On both sides of the space between the narthex and the naos, there are two arched niches in which are located the tombs of two of the monastery&rsquo;s founders (<em>ktetors</em>): the ruler of Wallachia Radu Mihnea (1586&ndash;1626) on the right, and the Patriarch Justinian Marina (1901&ndash;77) on the left. The naos is separated from the altar by a high iconostasis of sculpted and gilded wood built in a Baroque style in 1839, which is also the date when the canopy that covers the altar&rsquo;s table was created. Nevertheless, most of the icons of the iconostasis date to the 17th century. There are also 24 tombstones on both sides of the narthex, which are covered today by a glass floor, where various founders of the monastery or members of the Wallachian elite are buried. On the outside, the church is plastered with white parget, while a belt separates two unequal registers, each featuring simple ornamented arched niches. In 1714, a large porch with three arched entrances on each side was added to the narthex.<br />\r\nTo the northwest side of the church survives a bell tower that preserves its medieval form. In 1893, a large T-shaped building was erected to the south side of the church, which served at first as a Theological Boarding School, and today hosts the monastic cells and the refectory. To the southwest side of the church, the ruins of the princely palace, which underwent a process of restoration in 2015, are preserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nA princely charter (<em>hrisov</em>), dated 15 June 1577, attests to the beginnings of Radu Vod\u0103 Monastery. According to this document, the monastery was founded by the ruler of Wallachia Alexandru II (r. 1568&ndash;77) on the site of a medieval edifice. The same document informs that the lord planned for the church of the monastery to serve as the Metropolitanate of Wallachia and consecrated it to the Holy Trinity, bestowing it with many customs and villages. Although his successor, Mihnea II (r. I. 1577&ndash;83; II. 1585&ndash;91), is not mentioned as a founder due to his notorious conversion to Islam, he previously financed the completion of the monastery&rsquo;s buildings and painting, and endowed it in his turn with many properties, as indicated in a document dated 17 December 1586.<br />\r\nIn 1595, in the aftermath of the Ottoman military campaign directed by Sinan Pasha (1520&ndash;96) against Michael the Brave (r. 1599&ndash;1600), the monastery was devastated, as it served as one of Sinan&rsquo;s strongholds (&ldquo;Sinan&rsquo;s <em>palanca</em>&rdquo;). It was during the third reign in Wallachia of prince Radu Mihnea (r. I. 1601&ndash;02, II. 1611, III. 1611&ndash;16, IV. 1620&ndash;23) that the monastery was rebuilt and received until today the name of its benefactor. The transformation into a <em>metochion</em> of Iviron Monastery on Mount Athos is well-documented in a recently published charter dated 10 February 1613, which was sanctioned by Radu Mihnea, who himself might have spent a few years at the Athonite monastery before his reign. But the monastery had its own <em>metochions</em> (e.g., the churches of Bucur, Sts. Silvester and Foi\u0219or of Bucharest, the Monasteries of Bolintin and Fl\u0103m&acirc;nda, and the Sketes of Fundul Sacului, Izvorul Voievodului, M\u0103ne\u0219ti and Vorniceasa), which made it one of the most wealthy and influential monastic centers of Wallachia. The third founder of the monastery was prince Alexandru Coconul (r. 1623&ndash;27), Radu Mihnea&rsquo;s son, who completed the construction of the monastery&rsquo;s buildings and financed its painting program.<br />\r\nUnder the notorious Phanariot rules, which were not only characterized by multiple and short reigns of Greek princes, who were appointed by the Ottoman sultans to rule over the Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, but also marked a dark period in the historical consciousness of the Balkan people due to the political and economic instability, the monastery too reached a precarious economic and administrative situation. Moreover, the earthquakes of 1790, 1793, and 1794 also affected the structures. In 1863, along with the secularization of the wealth of the monasteries backed by Alexandru Ioan Cuza (r. 1859&ndash;66), this situation was aggravated. The monks were forced to leave the monastery, while it was transformed into a parish church. Between 1859 and 1864, the Austrian architect Johann Schlatter (1808&ndash;65) modified the initial form of the church by introducing neo-Gothic elements. The Theological Boarding School erected between 1894 and 1897, replaced the cells of the monastery, and the church became its chapel.<br />\r\nDuring the communist period, the monastery was disbanded, its buildings were seized, and within its premises functioned first a political school of the Communist Party and then the &ldquo;Ion Creang\u0103&rdquo; High School. Nevertheless, the site benefited from a restoration program between 1968 and 1971, led by the architect \u0218tefan Bal\u0219 (1902&ndash;94) and sponsored by the Romanian Patriarch Justinian Marina (1901&ndash;77), which restored the monastery&rsquo;s original appearance, removed the neo-Gothic elements, and embellished it with the painting that is still visible today. It was reactivated as a monastery in 1999 and still functioned as a chapel for the Orthodox Theological Seminary of Bucharest, whose new building was brought to completion in 2005 on the foothill of the monastery. Today, the monastery has a fruitful monastic life, numbering no less than 22 monks.<br />\r\nThe monastery was also an important cultural center, playing a crucial role in the social, artistic, literary, and educational life of the Wallachian milieu. During the 17th century, it developed a scriptorium, tending thus to the literary and liturgical demands of other ecclesiastical establishments and various intellectuals of the time, and it hosted one of the first libraries in Bucharest. Over the centuries, the monastery was visited by remarkable personalities that left their mark on its history. As such, the notorious Patriarch of Constantinople, Kyrillos Loukaris (1572&ndash;1638), sanctified the church in 1614 and endorsed the monastery&rsquo;s connection with Iviron, gifting it with books and liturgical objects. In his turn, Paul of Alep (1627&ndash;69), the secretary of the Patriarch of Antioch, Macarios III Zaim (r. 1647&ndash;72), left a rich description of the monastery in his journal, which he visited with the patriarch in his peregrination toward Muscovy.<br />\r\nRadu Vod\u0103 Monastery is also a place of worship and pilgrimage. In 2002, its congregation received a piece from the relics of St. Nectarios of Aegina, who has become the monastery&rsquo;s patron. In 2014, a fragment from the relics of St. Ephrem the Young were also attained by the monastery. As such, its importance among the Orthodox communities of Romania and Eastern Europe continues to grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nBal\u0219, \u0218tefan. &ldquo;Restaurarea Bisericii Radu Vod\u0103 din Bucure\u0219ti&rdquo; [The Restoration of the Radu Vod\u0103 Church of Bucharest]. <em>Revista Muzeelor \u0219i Monumentelor: Monumente istorice \u0219i de art\u0103</em> [<em>The Journal of Museums and Monuments: Historical and Art Monuments</em>] 1 (1975): 45&ndash;52.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This study, authored by the chief architect \u0218tefan Bal\u0219, offers a description of the restoration process of 1968-71.</p><p>(Arhim.)

    "text":"<p><em>By Alex Rodriguez Suarez </em>|<em> Independent Scholar</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe bell of Hieromonk Theodosios is a bronze artifact cast in 1270. It was found, together with another 13th-century bell, in the ruins of the church of St. Nicholas, Melnik (Bulgaria), in 2002. Today, it is on display in the National History Museum, Sofia (inventory number: 55902).<br />\r\nIts height measures 57 cm and its diameter is 42 cm. The bell does not display any decoration, and its crown, the top section designed to hang it, is made of a central ring to which two handles are attached. It is missing the clapper. The artifact was mainly employed to announce the religious service.<br />\r\nOn the lower part of the bell is a Greek inscription, cast in mirror reverse, that reads &Kappa;(&Upsilon;&Rho;&Iota;)&Epsilon; &Beta;&Omicron;&Eta;&Theta;&Epsilon;&Iota; &Tau;&Omicron;&Nu; &Delta;&Omicron;&Upsilon;&Lambda;(&Omicron;&Nu;) &Sigma;&Omicron;&Upsilon; &Theta;&Epsilon;&Omicron;&Delta;(&Omicron;)&Sigma;(&Iota;&Omicron;&Nu;) (?) &Iota;(&Epsilon;)&Rho;&Omicron;&Mu;(&Omicron;&Mu;&Alpha;&Chi;&Omicron;&Nu;) &Tau;(&Omicron;&Nu;) &Alpha;&Nu;A&Kappa;&Epsilon;&Nu;&Iota;&Sigma;&Alpha;&Nu;&Tau;&Alpha; &Tau;&Alpha;&Upsilon;&Tau;(&Eta;&Nu;) &Epsilon;&Pi;&Iota; &Beta;&Alpha;&Sigma;&Iota;(&Lambda;&Epsilon;&Iota;&Alpha;&Sigma;) &Mu;&Eta;&Chi;&Alpha;&Eta;&Lambda; TOY &Pi;&Alpha;&Lambda;&Alpha;&Iota;&Omicron;&Lambda;&Omicron;&Gamma;(&Omicron;&Upsilon;) &Kappa;&Alpha;&Iota; &Nu;&Epsilon;&Omicron;&Upsilon; &Kappa;&Omicron;&Nu;&Sigma;&Tau;&Alpha;&Nu;&Tau;(&Iota;&Nu;&Omicron;&Upsilon;) / &Kappa;&Omega;&Delta;&Omicron;&Nu;(&Alpha;) &Tau;&Omicron;&Upsilon; &Alpha;&Rho;&Chi;&Iota;&Sigma;&Tau;&Rho;&Alpha;&Tau;&Eta;&Gamma;&Omicron;&Upsilon; &Mu;&Eta;&Chi;(&Alpha;&Eta;&Lambda;) &Tau;&Omicron;&Upsilon; &Epsilon;&Nu; &Tau;&Omega; &Mu;&Epsilon;(&Lambda;&Epsilon;)&Nu;(&Iota;&Kappa;&Omega;) &Mu;&Eta;&Nu;(&Iota;) &Mu;&Alpha;&Rho;&Tau;&Iota;&Omicron; &Epsilon;&Nu;&Delta;&Iota;&Kappa;&Tau;&Iota;&Omicron;&Nu;&Omicron;&Sigma; &Iota;&Gamma; &Epsilon;&Tau;&Omicron;&Upsilon;&Sigma; \u03da&Psi;&Omicron;&Eta;.<br />\r\nTranslation: Lord, help your servant Theodosios, Hieromonk, who renewed this bell of the Chief Commander Michael of Melnik, during the reign of Michael Palaiologos and New Constantine, in the month of March, indiction 13, year 6778.<br />\r\nTheodosios is surely the monastic name of Theodore Komnenos Kantakouzenos, who is mentioned in two undated documents preserved in Vatopedi Monastery. He had been Grand Droungarios (of the Watch) and was buried in the monastery of the Virgin Spelaiotissa, Melnik. The use of the verb renew implies that the bell was recast after a previous artifact had broken. It has been suggested that the bell was donated to a monastery dedicated to St. Charalambos and the Archangels in Melnik and was later transferred to the church of St. Nicholas. However, the dedication might have been inspired by the presence of the future Michael VIII (r. 1259&ndash;83), who was governor of Melnik and Serres. In fact, when Michael became emperor he promoted the cult of the Archangel Michael.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nVery few bells produced before the Ottoman period have been preserved in the Balkans. Most were looted and melted down during the Ottoman conquest. The bell of Hieromonk Theodosios is so far the only such artifact clearly attributed to a Byzantine context. Two more bells with Greek inscriptions have survived. One, also found in Melnik, was donated by a member of the Bulgarian royal family during the first half of the 13th century. The other was given by a woman named Helen to an unknown church in 1458/59, after the Ottoman conquest of Byzantium.<br />\r\nThe adoption of bell ringing by the Byzantine Church, a process that started slowly in the 12th century, gained momentum in the 13th, when large swathes of the Byzantine territory were conquered by the armies of the Fourth Crusade and the Latin Empire of Constantinople was established. The bell of Hieromonk Theodosios confirms what written sources, for instance, such as the writings of George Pachymeres (1242&ndash;ca. 1310) and Patriarch John XI Bekkos (1275&ndash;82), report: The Byzantines had embraced the pealing of bells to call the faithful to mass and regulate the everyday life of monastic communities. Nevertheless, the traditional instrument of the Byzantines, the<em> semantron</em>, usually an elongated piece of wood that was struck with a wooden mallet, continued to be employed.<br />\r\nAs a result, the religious soundscape of the Late Byzantine period was eclectic; it was composed of the sounds of church bells and <em>semantra</em>. The use of bells was accompanied by the construction of bell towers, an architectural element that became common in the Palaiologan period. Thus, the adoption of bell ringing had a noteworthy impact on both the Byzantine soundscape and religious architecture.<br />\r\nThe inscription on the bell shows details characteristic of Byzantine dedicatory inscriptions. For example, the donor asks the Lord to help his servant, that is, Theodosios. The year is calculated since the creation of the world and the date includes the indiction. These elements indicate that, while church bells could be considered a Latin import, the artifacts were inscribed following the Byzantine tradition.<br />\r\nThe adoption of bell ringing provided the Byzantines &ndash; in this occasion, a monk &ndash; with further opportunities for artistic and religious patronage, even though Theodosios surely funded the recast of an already existing bell. On the other hand, the inscription does not include the name of the bell master. Actually, so far no Byzantine bell founder is known through his/her signature.<br />\r\nBecause of the language of the inscription the bell has recently been attributed to a Byzantine craftsman. Nonetheless, the artifact was cast with a type of crown found in earlier Western bells. This feature does not necessarily prove that the artifact was cast by a Western master, but it could suggest that local bell founders had copied Western models or had been trained by Westerners. Certainly, the adoption of bell ringing by the Orthodox communities of the Balkans resulted in the emergence of a local production of bells; however, the available information regarding this manufacture in the Byzantine Empire is currently scant.<br />\r\nWritten and material evidence demonstrates that several bell founders &ndash; Pribislav Radosali\u0107, Radoje Mali&scaron;i\u0107, a certain Benedeto, and Giovanni Battista of Rab &ndash; were active in Ragusa/Dubrovnik between the 14th and 16th centuries. The latter also cast cannons. Their presence seems to have turned the city into the most important bell casting center in the Balkans. Bell founders based there may have traveled inland to cast artifacts in situ.<br />\r\nBy contrast, Serbian and Byzantine monasteries also employed bells cast in Venice. This suggests that local bell founders did not cover the demand from churches and monasteries, and so production was sought in different areas. Alternatively, it might simply show that bells cast in Venice were better, cheaper, or easier to obtain.<br />\r\nThe Ottoman conquest prohibited the ringing of bells and so any local production of bells eventually faded. Bell casting was only available in vassal states of the Ottoman Empire such as the Republic of Ragusa and the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. Venetian bells continued to be imported, for instance, to Mount Athos, one of the few privileged locations allowed to use bells during the post-Byzantine period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nGerasimova, Vasilka. &ldquo;Dve kambani ot Melnik s nadpisi ot XIII v.&rdquo; (Two Bells From Melnik With Inscriptions From the 13th Century), <em>Arheologiya</em> 43, no. 3 (2003): 42&ndash;49.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This article presented the two bells from Melnik after they were discovered in 2002.

    "text":"<p><em>By Georgi Parpulov | Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G&ouml;ttingen</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThis large panel (107 &times; 74 cm) once formed part of an <u><strong><a href=\"http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CI%5CC%5CIconostasis.htm\">iconostasis</a></strong></u> screen in front of the altar inside an Orthodox church. Paired with a now-lost image of the adult Jesus Christ, it would have been placed next to a wooden door through which priests went in and out of the altar-space during the Divine Liturgy. A nameless artist has represented Jesus as a child held by His mother, whom an accompanying inscription terms &ldquo;Mother of God&rdquo; (compare the <u><a href=\"https://mappingeasterneurope.princeton.edu/item/the-icon-of-the-virgin-and-child-ohrid.html\"><strong>Ohrid Icon of the Virgin</strong></a></u>). Christ blesses us with his right hand and holds a rolled-up scroll that signifies His words and perhaps hints at the Gospel passage &ldquo;the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father&rdquo; (John 1:14). Above are the archangels Gabriel (on our left) and Michael (on the right) with their heads bowed and their hands fully covered as a sign of utmost respect. Dressed in royal tunics under bright red cloaks, the two celestial beings pay homage to Mary whom church hymns praise as &ldquo;more honorable than the cherubim and incomparably more glorious than the seraphim&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe painting style suggests that this icon, now in London, was produced between roughly 1450 and 1500 in what was then Poland&ndash;Lithuania. Ever since the Queen of Poland married the Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1385, the two countries had been ruled by a single monarch. The royal house and much of the kingdom&rsquo;s population stood under the religious authority of the Pope of Rome, but the easternmost part of the realm was inhabited by <u><a href=\"http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CR%5CU%5CRuthenians.htm\"><strong>Ruthenians</strong></a></u> (ancestors of the present-day Ukrainians and Belarusians) who belonged to the Orthodox Church and were subject to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Circa 1316, the patriarch appointed a separate metropolitan bishop for Ruthenia; in 1467, this arrangement was reconfirmed. The patriarchal see also is, in a manner of speaking, the ultimate source for the London icon, because the latter reproduces a famous portrait of the Virgin and Child believed to have been painted from life and housed in one of Constantinople&rsquo;s monasteries. The original, destroyed when the Ottoman Turks conquered the city in 1453, is known from surviving replicas (e.g. <u><a href=\"https://www.sinaiarchive.org/s/mpa/item/19012\"><strong>this 14th-century one</strong></a></u>), many of them inscribed with the epithet <u><a href=\"https://mappingeasterneurope.princeton.edu/item/the-church-of-the-mother-of-god-hodegetria-patria.html\"><em><strong>Hodegetria</strong></em></a></u>. Such Byzantine copies could have reached Poland&ndash;Lithuania by way of nearby <u><a href=\"http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CM%5CO%5CMoldavia.htm\"><strong>Moldavia</strong></a></u>, and Ruthenian artists would have diligently reproduced them in the belief that they were based on an actual portrait of Mary and Jesus. That process of artistic transmission may be compared to translating the Gospel from the original Greek into another language: the compositional layout of the prototype was retained (note especially the exact position of the faces, hands, and feet) but details of execution were altered, perhaps unconsciously, in tune with the training of local painters and with the taste of local patrons. The deep, contrasting colors, the sharply defined folds and wrinkles (particularly on the necks), the dark shadows (such as the crescent-shaped ones under the figures&rsquo; mouths) are all peculiar to Ruthenian icon-painting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nKruk, Miros\u0142aw Piotr. <em>Icons from the 14th&ndash;16th centuries in the National Museum in Krakow</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Olga Yunak | Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, CA</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Greek manuscript Synodal gr. 429, now housed at the State Historical Museum in Moscow, is a small book measuring 24 x 17.5 cm. This manuscript contains several poetic compositions celebrating the Virgin Mary. The texts include (in that order) the Akathistos Hymn, the Office of the Akathistos with the Canon to the Virgin by Joseph the Hymnographer (d. 886), the Canon of the Annunciation, and the Penitential Canon to the Immaculate Virgin by the Emperor Theodore II Doukas Laskaris (r. 1254&ndash;58), the two troparia written by the Patriarch Philotheos Kokkinos (o. 1353&ndash;54/5; 1364&ndash;76), and the Contritional Hymn by the Emperor Leo VI the Wise (r. 886&ndash;912).<br />\r\nIn this manuscript, the text of the Akathistos Hymn receives the most prominence. It is lavishly decorated with twenty-four miniatures, equal to the number of stanzas in the hymn. Each miniature is set against a rich golden background and framed by a design of green vegetation. The large initial letters of the text feature curious zoomorphic figures and elaborate floral designs in a peculiar entanglement of forms. The text is written in Greek miniscule in a combination of light brown ink and gold. Based on the methods of book production, some researchers believe that the manuscript was produced at the elite scriptorium of the Hodegon Monastery in Constantinople and attribute the script to Joasaph, the scribe who also had worked on a 1370 manuscript containing political and religious writings by Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos (r. 1347&ndash;54) (Par. Gr.1242). Another theory, however, disputes the 14th century dating of the book and places its production in the early 15th century based on the stylistic characteristics of the script. Although the dating of the book is disputed, as is the identity of its compiler, researchers generally agree that the Moscow manuscript represents one of the finest deluxe objects produced in late Byzantium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe Moscow manuscript belongs to the group of the four lavish manuscripts that contain the text of the Akathistos Hymn with illuminations. The Greek manuscript Escorial R.I.19 from the Real Biblioteca in Madrid is almost identical in contents and illustrations to the Moscow book (with some stylistic exceptions). In the 16th century, the Escorial came into the possession of the Spanish King Philip II (r. 1556&ndash;98). The other two manuscripts in this group are the Bulgarian Tomi\u0107 Psalter from the State Historical Museum in Moscow (Muz. 2752) and the Serbian Psalter from the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich (Slav. 4).<br />\r\nThe intended recipient of the Moscow manuscript is unknown. The small size of the book, however, suggests it was designed for a private user. According to one theory, this volume was meant as a gift to Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos after his deposition from the throne in 1354. Another theory suggests that the manuscript was destined to stay in Hodegon as a gift of personal supplication to the Virgin Mary. The Hodegon monastery at that time was an important Marian site and housed the most venerated icon of the Eastern Christian world, the Virgin Hodegetria. Stanza 23 of the Moscow book is accompanied by an illumination showing a procession with the Hodegetria icon.<br />\r\nLater, the Moscow book found itself in the possession of Tsar Alexei Michailovich of Russia (r. 1645&ndash;76) (father of Peter the Great, r. 1682&ndash;1725). The record in the customs register of 1662 indicates that the elders of the Church of the Holy Virgin of the Life-Giving Spring in Galata sent the Moscow manuscript to the Russian tsar. The letter accompanying the gift described a devastating fire in the monastery. The book was offered to the tsar in the hope that he would become a royal patron for the monastery. This letter reveals the Byzantine and post-Byzantine habit of re-fashioning objects of luxury as political gifts. Although we do not have direct evidence that the Moscow book was ever used as a political gift before 1662, it is quite possible that the book was initially produced with political intent in mind. The theory becomes even more plausible if we compare this manuscript with other luxurious works of art that were part of a power play within an elaborate system of diplomacy, widespread among contemporary ruling circles.<br />\r\nTwo such examples are the Greek manuscript (Louvre MR 416), a copy of the works of Dionysios the Areopagite (1st century ?), which is now kept in the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre in Paris, and the Staurotheke of Philotheos (1141), a reliquary designed to hold a relic of the true cross, now housed in the Moscow Kremlin. Both items are extravagant works of art fashioned as political gifts. The early 14th-century Dionysios manuscript was updated with lavish illuminations, one of them being the family portrait of the emperor. In 1407, the manuscript was sent to Paris as a diplomatic gift in an effort to remind the West of Dionysios&rsquo;s Greek origins and secure financial support. The Philotheos reliquary, as the legend holds it, was a political gift from the Patriarch Philotheos to the Grand Duke of Moscow Ivan (r. 1353&ndash;59). The political prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Philotheos, Metropolitan Alexi (o. 1354&ndash;78), brought this gift from Constantinople in 1354 as a symbol of patriarchal blessing.<br />\r\nThe Moscow manuscript, too, acquires the status of a precious gift imbued with political intent when placed in the context of the political interplay among royal courts. Thus, this manuscript can be seen as a carefully curated collection of the popular Marian poetry dressed in luxurious robes. Image and text cease to perform their basic functions&mdash;to show and to tell&mdash;but rather become ornamentation to showcase the luxury of the book. The poetic compositions function similarly to the epigrams inscribed on objects. The miniatures, too, acquire a new status: that of precious stones.<br />\r\nThe question that researchers still ask is why such an extravagant object was produced in the context of the decline of the empire&rsquo;s former powers and severe financial deprivations. Perhaps we may start answering this question if we consider the Moscow book along with other luxury objects that participated in the economy of political exchanges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nProkhorov, G.

    "text":"<p><em>By Nazar Kozak | National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Thematic </em><br />\r\n<strong>Overview </strong><br />\r\nThe Akathistos cycles are the Late and post-Byzantine sequences of pictorial scenes that illustrate an Early Byzantine liturgical hymn known as the Akathistos to the Mother of God.<br />\r\nComposed in the 5th century, in between the Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon (as Leena Marry Peltomaa argues based on its dogmatic content), the Akathistos hymn was firmly associated with the city of Constantinople. The Synaxarion&#39;s entry on the fifth Saturday of Lent (that day when the Akathistos is performed at the Orthros service) tells the story of how in the aftermath of the 626 siege, the people of Constantinople sang the Hymn in thanksgiving to the Virgin for her miraculous interference in the city&#39;s defense. (They sang it standing and from this custom comes the name Akathistos &ndash; meaning &quot;not sitting&quot; in Greek.)<br />\r\nDespite the hymn&#39;s long-term circulation in Byzantine liturgical practices, it was only in the Palaiologan era (1261-1453) that it found its way into the the Byzantine iconographic repertory. The earliest extant Akathistos cycles are dated to around the year 1300. At first, they circulated only in the Balkans, but eventually, in the post-Byzantine times they spread all around the Orthodox world from Cyprus in the south to the Tsardom of Muscovy in the north, and from the Ruthenian Galicia in the west to the Caucasus on the east.<br />\r\nVisual structures of Akathistos cycles corresponds to the textual structure of the Akathistos hymn. The Hymn consists of twenty-four strophes or stanzas (gr. oikoi) preceded by initial verses (gr. prooimii). Most of the Akathistos cycles contain twenty-four scenes that illustrate these twenty-four stanzas of the main part of the hymn, but also some cycles feature the illustration of the second prooimion or even contain additional illustrations for selected strophes. The opposite tendency is also evident&mdash;some cycles skip some of the strophes and thus consist of a lesser number of scenes than 24. In most cases, the identification of the Akathistos scenes is assisted by the inscriptions featuring the initial lines of the strophes.<br />\r\nTo a great extent, the iconography of the Akathistos cycles was based on the iconography of the Christological and Mariological cycles. The scenes of the Annunciation, including the Annunciation at the Well, Visitation, Doubts of Joseph, Nativity, the Story of the Magi, Flight into Egypt, Presentation in the Temple, Road to Calvary, Crucifixion, Anapeson, Anastasis, and other were adopted for the illustrations of the Akathistos strophes. For that reason, it can be difficult to identify partly preserved Akathistos cycles because their iconography can match well-known Gospel scenes. This of course does not mean that the Akathistos iconography was completely unoriginal.<br />\r\nThe Akathistos illustrators were quite inventive in the reinterpretation of the existing iconography as well as in creating new schemes. The most well-known of those inventions is the illustrations of Strophe 21 that explore the metaphor of the Virgin as a candle. The Virgin is either represented with a candle in her hands or next to the column crowned with flames, or even inside a giant mandorla of burning flames. Speaking on the level of a basic compositional layout, the most popular scheme that can be identified in the Akathistos scenes represents the main actor (the Virgin, Christ, the Virgin with Christ Child, or even an icon) venerated by two symmetric groups of people (apostles, saints, kings, bishops, orators, singers, laymen).<br />\r\nAlthough each strophe was illustrated in multiple ways, the individual Akathistos cycles are not completely different. Quite the contrary; they can be linked into groups or types based on the shared similarities or sets of traits that distinguish the groups from one another. The optics used for the identification of these traits should not focus on minor iconographic details because in that case, the types of the Akathistos cycle will multiply exponentially. Rather, the most reasonable criterion here should be the subject matter of a scene and a scene&#39;s placement in the sequence of a cycle.<br />\r\nThe majority of the extant Akathistos cycles are available for study in the wall-painting and icons, yet there are also several examples in books and liturgical textiles. Among the most well-known and well-preserved Akathistos cycles one can mention the wall-paintings in the Marko Monastery (1376&ndash;81), the Ferapontov monastery (1502), the Moldovi\u0163a monastery (1537), and the refectory of the Great Lavra at the Mount Athos (1535&ndash;41); the icon in the Dormition Cathedral in Moscow Kremlin (ca. 1400); the miniatures in the Tomi\u010d Psalter from the State Historical Museum in Moscow (ca. 1360) and the Munich Serbian Psalter from The Bavarian State Library in Munich (1396&ndash;1410); the woodcuts in the Triodion printed in Kyiv in 1627; the epitrachelion of Archpriest Dorotheos from the Stavronikita Monastery at the Mount Athos (16th century).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\n<p>Based on the scope of their engagement with the topic, the studies on the Akathistos cycles can be divided into four groups:</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">1) studies focused on a single cycle, which is often a part of a broader program of a church or a manuscript decoration. The pioneering works of this kind by Josef Strzygowski (1906) about the Munich Serbian Psalter was succeeded by many others such as the article by Tania Velmans (1972) on the Escorial codex, and the monograph by Maria Aspra Bardabake (1992) on the codex Garrett 13 at Princenton University, to mention just a few example;</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">2) studies focused on groups of the cycles. For the examples of this category see the monograph by Ruth Farbitius (1999) and the article by Cons\u0163anta Costea (2009) on the Akathistos cycles in the 16th-century Moldavian principality;</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">3) generalized studies on the Akathistos iconography that attempt to discuss as many cycles as possible. The article by Josef Myslivec (1932) and the monograph by Ioannis Spatharakis (2005) are the most cited works in this category;</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">4) studies focused on the illustration of specific strophes. See for instance an article by Marka Tomic Djuric (2011) about the illustration of the concluding strophes of the Akathistos Hymn;</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">5) studies that refer to the Akathistos cycles along with other evidence for the main argument. For a recent example of such a study see the article by Alice Isabella Sullivan (2017) on the scene of the Siege of Constantinople.</p><p>From their very beginnings at the turn of the 20th century, the studies of the Akathistos cycles were centered on issues of iconography. Scholars identified scenes in the cycles as illustrations of the strophes of the hymn, investigated their compositional sources, compared and contrasted the depictions of the same strophe in different cycles, and identified the iconographic types of the cycles as a specific sequence of specific scenes.<br />\r\nOccasionally, this approach led to broader conclusions. Thus, Nikodim Kondakov (1902) outlined the chronological relationship between different types of the Akathistos cycles, claiming that with time the laconic symbolism was succeeded by lavish narrativism. Joseph Myslivec (1932), in turn, evaluated the originality of the Akathistos iconography. He indentified two divergent modalities that were used for the illustration of the two parts of the Akathistos Hymn: strophes 1-12 and strophes 13-24 correspondingly (to be precise he wrote that strophes 4, 11, and 18 use both of these modalities). As result, according to Myslivec, the first part of the cycle consists of the scenes &quot;taken unchanged&quot; from the pre-existing Christological and Mariological compositions, and the second part (strophes 13-24) consists of &quot;original schemes.&quot;<br />\r\nLater on, Jacqueline Lafontaine-Dosogne (1984) contested the conclusion about the traditionality of the scenes of the first part of the hymn (strophes 1-12) by showing their variety both on the level of the subject matter and compositional layouts. More recently, Ioannis Spatharakis (2005) published an exhaustive analysis of almost all known late Byzantine Akathistos cycles to offer a reconstruction of the first unpreserved Akathistos cycle created in Constantinople in the 13th century. However, his sampling from the post-Byzantine was quite scarce.<br />\r\nSeveral scholars, following the paradigm of Panofsky&#39;s iconology, tried to link the Akathistos cycles with the historic context of the time. Probably the best known of such studies connects the emergence of the Akathistos cycles with the rise of the hesychastic movement during the Palaiologan period. Thus, \u0410lexandra P&auml;tzold (1989) pointed to the occurrence of early Akathistos cycles in monastic churches, which at that time were centers of hesychasm. She also linked certain developments in the Akathistos iconography with the hesychast theological ideas. For instance, according to P&auml;tzold, the representation of the veil raised behind the Virgin in the illustration of Strophe 4 creates a &#39;negative&#39; space and thus symbolizes the insensible reality of God to which Gregory Palamas constantly referred to in his sermons; and the most popular iconographic scheme used for the illustration of the Akathistos strophes &ndash; the representation of believers next to Christ or the Virgin &ndash; envisions a core hesychast concept of theosis, that is the deification of man, who through it achieves unity with God.<br />\r\nSimilarly, Efthalia Constantinides (1992) linked the translation of the Akathistos Hymn into visual media to the victory of the hesychasts over the unionists in 1282 and interpreted the constant employment of the mandrola motif in the Akathistos iconography as evidence of the hesychast influence on art. A case of bridging a single Akathistos cycle with a political context of its age could be also found in E.B. Gromova&#39;s (2005) monograph on the late Byzantine Akathistos icon from the Dormition Cathedral in Moscow Kremlin. She explains the misordered placement of the Akathistos scenes on this icon by the author&#39;s or donor&#39;s desire to encode visually a narrative about early Muscovite history.<br />\r\nThe Akathistos cycles have been also discussed in scholarship associated with the &quot;new&quot; art history. Thus, Nancy P. &Scaron;ev\u010denko (1991) addressed the Akathistos cycle in her study of the icons&#39; role in the Byzantine liturgy. While Henry Maguire (2012) in his monograph on the representation of nature in Byzantine art referred to the alleged &ldquo;artistic poverty&rdquo; of the Akathistos cycles in the representation of nature-derived metaphors (lavishly present in the Akathistos hymn) as evidence of the nature&#39;s negation in Byzantine art after iconoclasm.<br />\r\nRecently (2022), I have revisited the iconographic typology of the Akathistos cycles through the lens of the mobility paradigm and the mapping methodology to understand how accessing the iconographic mobility of the types of the Akathistos cycles can impact the understanding of the geography of post-Byzantine art. I argue that seen through an iconographic mobility lens this geography emerges as a coherent interconnected whole rather than a patchwork of national schools. My research drew on the corpus of the forty-three Akathistos cycles preserved in 16th-century wall-paintings across Eastern Europe.<br />\r\nIf the breakthrough in computational processing of visual data itself would be achieved in the future it may lead to unprecedented insights into the connections between the Akathistos cycles across time and space, especially in light of the graph theory. These insights potentially will have far-reaching implications for expanding our knowledge about (post-)Byzantine societal structures and processes of transregional exchange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nConstantinides, Efthalia C. <em>The Wall Paintings of the Panagia Olympiotissa at Elasson in Northern Thessaly</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Nazar Kozak | National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine </em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nThe 17th-century iconostasis from the church of the Dormition of the Mother of God in Lviv has an eventful and complex history. In 1616, the Lviv Stavropigiia Brotherhood, the most prominent Ruthenian Orthodox layman organization in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, provided finances to Fedir Senkovych (? &ndash;1631), a renowned Lviv icon painter who worked both for Orthodox and Latin donors, to paint icons for the Dormition church. Unfortunately, the artist&#39;s house and workshop were destroyed by fire in 1623, and probably the initial set of icons was destroyed then, too. Senkovych had to restart his project from scratch. The work was completed by the year 1630 when the iconostasis was assembled inside the church. Yet again, soon after the installation, lightning hit the iconstasis through the window and all the icons were blackened. The restoration was carried out by Senkovych&rsquo;s students and helpers apparently without any participation from the master, who died the following year. In 1637&ndash;38, the most prominent of Senkovych&rsquo;s students and his successor as the workshop leader and owner Mykola Petrakhnovych Morokhovsky (ca. 1600&ndash; after 1666), supplemented the initial structure with an additional set of images.<br />\r\nIn the next century, the new church authorities decided to replace the &ldquo;high&rdquo; iconostasis painted by Senkovych and Petrakhnovych Morokhovsky with a lower and more &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; templon. Thus, in 1767, the iconostasis was sold to the nearby village of Velyki Hrybovychi. The major part of the iconostasis is still there, awaiting the much needed restoration. The Passions scenes, however, remained in the Dormition Church in Lviv. They were rearranged into two vertical sets and hung near the edges of the sanctuary&rsquo;s wall. Several icons from the iconostasis also found their way into museum collections. For instance, the images of St. John Chrysostomos and St. Basil the Great are now exhibited in Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv.<br />\r\nAs proposed reconstructions of the iconostasis suggest, it consisted of five tiers. The lower or the so-called namisnyi (sovereign) tier featured the icons of Christ Pantokrator and the Virgin Hodegetria, as well as the Nativity and the Dormition of the Mother of God. This set of four icons was interrupted by three doors lavishly adorned with floral ornaments and miniature icons depictihng the scene of Annunciation and figures of four Evangelists. The next two tiers featured two sets of icons illustrating the main feast of the Christian calendar and the Passions of Christ correspondingly. The largest tier of the iconostasis &mdash; the so-called De&euml;sis &mdash; included the full-scale images of the twelve Apostles headed by the images of the Virgin and St. John the Baptist next to the central figure of Christ. Above the Apostles, one can still see medallions with the images of Old Testament Prophets. The iconostasis was topped by a Crucifixion consisting of cutout figures of Christ on the cross, the Virgin, Mary Magdalene, John the Evangelist, and St. Longinus. If Senkovych has painted icons for the three tiers &mdash; the sovereign, the Feasts, and the Prophets &mdash; Petrakhnovych Morokhovsky supplemented these with two additional tries of the Passions and the De&euml;sis, which were placed above the Feasts and below the Prophets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nThe iconostasis from the Dormition church offers several interesting puzzles to be solved. First, since it was disassembled and displaced and its icons are distributed between different locations, debates have arisen over its original layout. Although scholars were consonant about the arrangement of the icons between the tiers, the exact placement of some individual icons on each of the tiers remains doubtful. Another problem is identification of authorship. The majority of the icons are preserved under layers of later overpainting, so their restoration could bring a more nuanced understanding of how the work was distributed between Senkovych and Petraknovych. Finally, besides these connoisseurship issues, the iconostasis is also important from the standpoint of social art history given the complexity of the context in which it was created.<br />\r\nAs the central element in the decoration of the main church of the Lviv Orthodox Eparchy, this iconostasis was important not just for liturgical use but for its ideological significance related to the process of confessionalization that was taking place in the region in the 16th and the 17th centuries. It was an era of polemical literature, of acute conflict over questions of Faith. After the Union of Brest in 1596, the Kyivan Metropolitanate broke away from the Patriarchate of Constantinople and united with the See of Rome. The Eparchy of Lviv was one of those few Kyivan church&#39;s units that rejected the Union of Brest. This put it at the forefront of the struggle for its confessional identity against the power of the Uniat Metropolitan and the Polish-Lithuania authorities. The Lviv Stavropigiia Brotherhood fostered this struggle by all possible means including visual arts. The Dormition church and its iconostasis became a central project that was carried through decades as a way to reassert Orthodoxy into the Latin-dominated landscape of Lviv. To achieve this, they needed to win a competition with the art of the Latins.<br />\r\nContemporaries characterized Senkovych&#39;s manner of icon-painting as &ldquo;tender,&rdquo; meaning a special sensuality of his images produced by an innovative combination of tempera with oil painting as well as Byzantine iconography with an increased three-dimensionality of human bodies. Petrachnovych Morohowsky went even further borrowing the compositional layouts for his Passion scenes from the engravings of a Wierix family (active in the late 16th and early 17th centuries) and informing the images of the Apostles with a deep physiological characterization reminiscent of the Renaissance and Mannerist paintings.<br />\r\nSeen through the lens of the contemporary religious controversy, this new eclectic style of the iconostasis brought together Byzantine and Western elements, emerging as a way for donors and artist to reinvent Orthodox art in the early modern contemporaneity complicated by the need for flexibility in the face of religious and political controversies. This new stylistic trend had not begun with this iconostasis from the Dormition church in Lviv, but that iconostasis became its major achievement and a model for later major artworks in the region of the Ruthenian Galicia such as iconostases in the St. Paraskevy church in Lviv (ca. 1645), the Holy Spirit Church in Rohatyn (ca. 1650), and many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nMiliaeva, Lada and Maria Helytovych. <em>The Ukrainian Icon of the 11th-18th Centuries</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Ljubica Vinulovi\u0107 | Department of Art History, University of Belgrade&ndash;Faculty of Philosophy </em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nFrom the middle of the 20th century onward, the icon from Poganovo monastery has been the subject of research among scholars scientists. It was found in the monastery of Saint John the Theologian near Poganovo. For some time, the icon was kept in the crypt of the Cathedral Church of Alexander Nevsky in Sofia, Bulgaria. It was recently moved to the Archeological Museum in Sofia.<br />\r\nThe icon is double-sided object; one side shows the Miracle of Latomos. This composition is very specific and appears only three time in Early Christian and Byzantine visual culture: in the mosaic in the apse of the church of Hosios David in Thessaloniki from the 5th or 6th century, in mural painting in the upper church of the ossuary of the Bachkovo monastery from the 12th century and in the Icon from Poganovo from the 14th century. On the other side, the icon shows the Mother of God and St. John the Evangelist. The Mother of God bears the epithet <em>Kataphyge</em> which means refuge, and John the Theologian.<br />\r\nThe votive inscription in Greek on in the icon &ldquo;[&Epsilon;&lambda;\u03ad&nu;&eta; \u03ad]&nu; &Chi;(&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;)&omega; &tau;&omega; &Theta;(&epsilon;)&omega; &pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;\u03ae &beta;&alpha;&sigma;\u03af&lambda;&iota;&sigma;&sigma;&alpha;&rdquo; (in Christ God the faithful <em>basilissa</em> Helena) written between the figures of the Mother of God and St. Jonh, incited a question about the ktetor&rsquo;s identity among researchers. According to the title <em>basilissa</em> the older generation of researchers, such as Andr&eacute; Grabar, Todor Gerasimov, and Andr&eacute; Xyngopoulos, considered that the ktetor of the icon was the Byzantine empress Helena Draga&scaron; Palaiologina (r. 1392&ndash;1424). Gordana Babi\u0107 offered a different hypothesis about the ktetor&rsquo;s identity. According to the inscriptions in documents and frescoes, she came to the conclusion that the title <em>basilissa</em> was applied to the wife of the despot. Based on the complex iconography and the Mother of God&rsquo;s epithet, she argued that the ktetor of the Icon from Poganovo was<em> basilissa</em> Helena Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 (c. 1349&ndash;1405). This interpretation has been accepted among researchers to this day. Based on its stylistic features, the icon was probably painted after 1371 in a workshop in Thessaloniki.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\n<em>Basilissa</em> Helena Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 (c. 1349&ndash;1405), the nun Euphemia, is the most often mentioned in historiography and literature as the first Serbian female poet. Helena was very educated and talented, according to the poems she wrote. She had a very tragic destiny. First, she lost her only son Uglje&scaron;a Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107, who died at a very young age (d. b. 1368&ndash;1371). He was buried in the <em>katholikon </em>of Hilandar monastery at the place where Helena could never go. Soon after she lost her son, she lost her husband despot John Uglje&scaron;a Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 (r. 1364/65&ndash;1371) on 26th of September 1371, at the Battle of \u010cernomen in the valley of the Marica River. After the defeat of the Serbian army, Helena lost her home too and moved to Thessaloniki. During the Early Christian period, there was a monastery dedicated to the Mother of God Kataphyge in Thessaloniki where the cult of the Virgin Kataphyge was extremely developed. Apparently, Helena encountered with this cult and the story of the Miracle of Latomos in Thessaloniki.<br />\r\nFinally, she went to the court of Prince Lazar (r. 1373&ndash;1389) in Kru&scaron;evac and lived under his protection for several years until his death at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. After that, Helena took the monastic vows, becoming nun Euphemia. She probably spent her last days in Ljubostinja monastery.<br />\r\nThese tragedies that forever marked Helena&rsquo;s life were reflected in her votive gifts. Due to her personal fate and the tragedy that connects her with the Mother of God, she symbolically represents the reflection of the Mother of God on earth. Her personal faith and tragedy are reflected through the composition of the Miracle of Latomos and the depiction of the Mother of God <em>Kataphyge</em> on the icon from Poganovo, which Helena commissioned as the votive gift for her protector and intercessor, the Mother of God.<br />\r\nThe story about the Miracle of Latomos can be traced back to the end of the 3rd century AD, and it is closely related to the city of Thessaloniki and to princess Theodora, the daughter of August Galerius (r. 305&ndash;311). This composition tells the story about the miraculous transformation of the image of the Mother of God into the image of Christ Emmanuel that happened according to God&rsquo;s will. In the mosaic in the apse of Theodora&rsquo;s palace, Christ Emmanuel is seated on a rainbow encircled by the mandorla and four animals &ndash; the symbols of the four evangelists flanked by the figures of two prophets. The palace was burnt to the ground, but the mosaic stayed preserved by God&rsquo;s will. The place where the palace stood was named Latomia, according to the Greek word for stone, because the whole palace was built of stone. In 1921, the church was dedicated to the local saint Hosios David. Today, in the apse of this church Theodora&rsquo;s mosaic can be seen. The iconography of this composition indicates that it is a scene of the Second Coming of Christ.<br />\r\nThe Miracle of Latomos on the icon from Poganovo is depicted in a different way from that in the mosaic in Hosios David. Christ Emmanuel, dressed in a golden chiton is depicted enthroned on a golden rainbow, surrounded with the mandorla composed of seven blue rings. He is encircled with the symbols of the four evangelists. His arms and feet bear marks of the Crucifixion. Around him is the inscription: &ldquo;&delta; \u03ad&nu; &tau;&omicron; &Lambda;&alpha;&tau;\u03cc&mu;&omicron;&upsilon; &theta;&alpha;\u03cd&mu;&alpha;&rdquo; (the Miracle of Latomos). The inscription around Christ&rsquo;s head and torso directly connects this icon with the mosaic from Hosios David. In the lower zone of the icon, below Christ is a mountainous landscape with a water basin, where seven fish swim. Two prophets, Ezekiel and Habakkuk flank this composition. They saw God in the form of light surrounded by the four tetramorphs which are symbols of the four Evangelists. The composition depicted in this way can be interpreted at the same time as Theophany and as Parousia, the Second Coming of Christ. As we have already mentioned, the whole composition is slightly different from that in Hosios David. On the icon, Christ is depicted with wounds on his hands and feet, while in the mosaic he does not have wounds. Given the fact that Christ is depicted in this way, this scene indicates the moment after the Crucifixion. The seven rings of the mandorla and seven fish that swim in the water basin point to the symbolism of the Last Judgment. During the Revelation of John the Theologian, God showed himself to John in the form of light on a throne, surrounded by the symbols of the four evangelists.<br />\r\nOn the front side, the Mother of God <em>Kataphyge</em> and John the Theologian are painted. In the lower zone between them is in quite damaged condition the donor&rsquo;s inscription printed in red: &ldquo;In Christ God the faithful <em>basilissa</em> Helena&rdquo;. This votive inscription replaces Helena&rsquo;s portrait on the icon. The Mother of God stands on the left side, dressed in a blue maphorion, her head is lowered, and she is in deep sorrow. Special emphasis in this depiction is on the Mother of God&rsquo;s human suffering and mourning for her son. Mother of God and Helena had the same tragic fate, they survived the loss of the only son and that unites them.<br />\r\nNext to her head is the inscription written in red, <em>Kataphyge</em>. The icon from Poganovo is the last known example where this epithet was use in visual culture.. The epithet <em>Kataphyge</em> also closely links the Mother of God and Helena. Helena identified her grief for little Ugljesa with the Mother of God&rsquo;s grief for Christ. Through the Mother of God, Helena was searching for refuge, <em>kataphyge</em>, in this life. Through this depiction and epithet Helena identified herself with the Mother of God and became her reflection on earth.<br />\r\nNext to the Mother of God, John the Evangelist is depicted. He is signed as John the <em>Theologian</em> and shown as an elderly man, as the author of the Revelation. With his right hand he gestures to the other side of the icon. The Battle of the Maritsa River took place on the 26th of September. On this day, the church celebrates the Metastasis of John the Theologian. John Uglje&scaron;a shares the name of the patron saint, and he died on the saint&rsquo;s day.<br />\r\nThe icon from Poganovo, Helena&rsquo;s votive gift, represents a unique example in the visual culture of medieval Serbia, and Byzantium more broadly. Through this icon, Helena was praying for salvation for herself and her loved ones. Th\u0435 icon has an eschatological character. The composition of the Miracle of Latomos expands the legend of the healing power of the place where it happened, and it could be interpreted as a wish of the ktetor to find peace and refuge after personal tragedy. The Second Coming of Christ represents salvation for her. During the Resurrection of the dead, she will be reunited with her husband and son in the dwellings of the righteous of the Heavenly Jerusalem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nBabi\u0107, Gordana. &ldquo;Sur l&rsquo;ic&ocirc;ne de Poganovo et la vasilissa H&eacute;l&egrave;ne.&rdquo; In<em> L&lsquo;art de Thessalonique et des pays Balkaniques et les courants spirituels au XVIe si&egrave;cle</em>, edited by Dinko Davidov, 57&ndash;65.

    "text":"<p><em>By An\u0111ela Gavrilovi\u0107 | University of Belgrade </em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nA shallow niche in the lunette above the entrance to the church of the Transfiguration of Christ in Zrze Monastery (1368/69) preserves a mural of the composition of the Transfiguration of Christ. The katholikon of the monastery was built and decorated with frescoes in several phases. In the first stage, the small church was built by monk German as his endowment around the middle of the 14th century, followed by a second phase, in which the nartex was added on the west (before 1368/69). In the third stage, the northern and southern parecclesions have been added (the end of the 16th and the first half of the 17th century), while at the beginning of the 17th century an opened porch was built on the west. The first church is a single nave edifice with a semi-circular vault and gabled roof. The apse is three-sided on the outside, and semicircular on the inside. Since the original western entrance of the first church was demolished after the restoration of frescoes in 16th century, the nartex and the naos now form a single space. The Transfiguration mural was executed together with the frescoes of the narthex of the church &ndash; in the seventh decade of the 14th century (before 1368/69). Today, it is protected by the opened porch.<br />\r\nThe key mural in the church consists of two parts, which form one symbolic whole. The central part of the niche features the scene of the Transfiguration. It is surrounded in the archivolt by the figures of the Mother of God with the Christ Child and eight prophets.<br />\r\nViewed as a separate scene, the iconography of the Transfiguration fresco relies on traditional Byzantine iconography. At the top of the scene, Christ is depicted on Mount Tabor in glory with a cruciform halo. He is shown full-length, in white robes, and with a double mandorla emitting rays. He blesses with his right hand. Moses is located on the right, and Elijah on the left. Christ, Moses, and Eliah stand on three separate peaks of Tabor, while below them are three apostles: John, Peter, and James.<br />\r\nThe Mother of God with the Christ Child is depicted bust-length at the top of the archivolte that surrounds the Transfiguration. Next to her are figures of the prophets: David and Solomon, Ezekiel and Isaiah, Gedeon and Jona, and Habacuc and Saint John the Forerunner. The first three pairs of prophets are depicted as busts, while Habacuc and Saint John the Forerunner are shown full length. Through gestures and gazes, all prophets point to the Mother of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nThe appearance of the Transfiguration fresco on the west fa&ccedil;ade of the main church at Zrze Monastery is justified by the fact that the very church is dedicated to this feast. The Transfiguration fresco over the entrance to the katholikon of Zrze Monastery is original and unique in many ways. First, because it consists of two parts that are connected into one symbolic whole through iconography: the scene itself and the figures in the archivolte. In Serbian medieval art, the iconographic solution of the Transfiguration fresco at Zrze is unique as no other monument features the Transfiguration scene in such a way. The iconography is the result of nuanced theological thoughts and the aspirations of the patrons of the frescoes, the two noblemen Pribil (later painter and metropolitan Jovan, middle of the 14th century &ndash;the end of the 14th century) and Prijezda (later painter hieromonk Makarije, 14th century &ndash; after 1421/22).<br />\r\nZrze Monastery, like Lesnovo Monastery, was an important medieval monastic center with a long tradition, where complex theological thoughts could be expressed in the language of images and art. The katholikon of Zrze Monastery was originally built as inheritance church by monk German (second half of the 13th century ? &ndash; first half of the 14th century), a former nobleman of king and later tzar Du&scaron;an (r.1331&ndash;1355). His son, Hajko (beginning of the 14th century &ndash;1368/69), became a monk named Hariton and was buried in the church after his passing, sometime before 1368/69. At that time, his sons, Pribil and Prijezda, together with their mother, decorated the nartex with frescoes in his memory. This act is preserved in the inscription on the west wall of the nartex. The Transfiguration fresco above the entrance to the church belongs to this fresco layer.<br />\r\nThe Mother of God with the Christ Child at the top of the archivolte inscribed with the epithet &ldquo;Joy of all&rdquo; (&Pi;\u03ac&nu;&tau;&omega;&nu; &chi;&alpha;&rho;\u03ac), which is not so frequent in Byzantine art or in the medieval art of Eastern Europe. Apart from Zrze Monastery this epithet is found in the church of Christ the Lifegiver in Borje (1390/91). This epithet can also refer to Christ (for example, He is inscribed with this epithet on one fresco in Ro\u017eenski Monastery in Bulgaria &ndash; 1597). The prophets who surround the Transfiguration fresco point to the human nature of God, that is to the incarnation of Christ through the Virgin. Christ&rsquo;s incarnation is especially emphasized by the presence of the main witness of His human nature &ndash; Saint John the Forerunner and his peculiar gesture of raised right hand and forefinger. The epithet of the Mother of God &ldquo;Joy of all&rdquo;, aligns with the symbolism of the texts on the prophets&rsquo; rolls, which can also point to Christ, since the Mother of God bore &ldquo;the One who is everywhere, to fill everything with joy&rdquo;, abolishing the old curse.<br />\r\nThe most important feature of the fresco-icon of the Transfiguration above the entrance in Zrze Monastery is the deep theological symbolism that connects this scene with the figures of the Mother of God with Christ Child and prophets, relying on the text of the service of the Transfiguration feast and visually interpreting the Transfiguration scene, emphasizing the fact that &ldquo;the One seen by Moses on Tabor&rdquo; is &lsquo;the God born from the young Virgin, who is the deliverance of men&rdquo;.<br />\r\nThe service also explains that the Father&rsquo;s voice during the Transfiguration in fact &ldquo;revealed the secret of God&rsquo;s incarnation: the Only Begotten Son and the Savior of the Whole World&rdquo;. Thus, the Father&rsquo;s words represent the testimony and the confirmation of this mystery. Through His incarnation, Christ revealed an eternal mystery that was hidden, and human eyes saw the unseen: the earthly flesh shone with divine radiance, the mortal body radiated the glory of God. Precisely due to the fact that Christ is the Only Begotten Son, He is also the Savior of the World. Given the fact that the Transfiguration fresco was illustrated for the memory of the soul of Hajko, later monk Hariton, it is obvious that his sons Pribil and Prijezda in the funerary church of their grandfather and their father, chose the themes that emphasize Christ&rsquo;s human nature and His Transfiguration, since in the mystery of Christ&rsquo;s Incarnation lies the pledge of eternal salvation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\n\u010cubrilo Golac, Andrijana, &ldquo;Freska Preobra\u017eenja u manastiru Zrze&rdquo;, <em>Patrimonium</em> 18 (2020): 401&ndash;410.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This article is the first thorough study of the fresco-icon of the Transfiguration on the western fa&ccedil;ade in Zrze Monastery.</p><p>\u010cubrilo, Andrijana, &ldquo;Zidno slikarstvo crkve Preobra\u017eenja Hristovog u manastiru Zrze&rdquo;, Beograd 2019 (unpublished PhD thesis, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Belgrade).</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">In this doctoral thesis, the frescoes of the church of Transfiguration executed in different periods, are examined in detail for the first time and from the aspect of the whole monument.</p><p>Gavrilovi\u0107, An\u0111ela, &ldquo;O bogoslovskim idejnim osnovama ikonografsko-programskog re&scaron;enja scene Preobra\u017eenja Hristovog nad ulazom u crkvu Preobra\u017eenja u manastiru Zrze&rdquo;, <em>Patromonium 19</em> (2021) 275&ndash;285.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">&gt;This study deals with the strong symbolic connection that lies between the Transfiguration fresco on the one hand, and with the Mother of God with Christ Child and prophets.</p><p>This contribution was sponsored by the <u><a href=\"https://maryjahariscenter.org/\"><strong>Mary Jaharis Center for Byzantine Art and Culture</strong></a></u> at Hellenic College Holy Cross.</p>",

    "text":"<p><em>By <a href=\"https://en-uoa-gr.academia.edu/MariaVavva\"><u><strong>Maria Vavva</strong></u> </a>| National and Kapodistrian University of Athens </em><br />\r\n<p><strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe large Crucifix (Crux Magna), as it is known in the literature, is a large painted cross that was used to top an iconostasis. Today, this example is preserved in the Icon Museum of Kor\u010dula, which belongs to the fraternity of All Saints in the city.<br />\r\nIt survives only in a fragment of the vertical section. The horizontal limbs, the top and bottom parts, and the frame decoration are missing. According to Francesco Radi\u0107, who saw it almost complete (1892), the limbs had four-leaf medallions with the symbols of the evangelists on the end. Each horizontal limb measured 100 cm in length.<br />\r\nThe part of the icon that is preserved measures 2.34 x 51 cm and is executed in tempera on wood. The body of Christ is painted on a wooden cross against a golden background, following the conventional post-Byzantine manner. He is depicted dead with his head tilted toward his shoulder. The lifeless body hangs from its shoulders with the crossed feet nailed to the arm of the cross. A short girdle wraps his waist tightly. On the upper end of the painted board is attached the Greek titulus &Iota;&Nu;&Beta;&Iota;, an abbreviation for the words &Iota;&Eta;CO&Upsilon;C &Nu;&Alpha;&Zeta;&Omega;&Rho;&Alpha;&Iota;&Omicron;C &Beta;&Alpha;C&Iota;&Lambda;&Epsilon;&Upsilon;C &Iota;&Omicron;&Upsilon;&Delta;&Alpha;&Iota;&Omega;&Nu; (John 19:19) [Jesus the Nazarene King of the Jews].<br />\r\nAccording to local tradition, it was brought to Kor\u010dula from Crete with the galley of a Kor\u010dulan nobleman in 1668, a year before the surrender of Candia to the Turks. This information has been recorded by the chronographer Petar Dimitri Dimitrije: &ldquo;dalli muri di questa chiesa stavano appesi molti quadri di pittura greca che con due croci che pure erano colocatein essa chiesa fatte di tavola con cornici all&#39;estremita indorate sono stati transportati da Candia, nell&#39; anno in cui i Veneti si ritiravano da colla, da una galera curzolana commandata in qualita di sopracomito da un nobile di Curzola e donati in detta chiesa&rdquo; / &ldquo;on the walls of this church hung many paintings in the Greek style, which with two crosses that were also placed in this church, made of wood panel with gilded frames, have been transported from Candia, in the year in which the Venetians withdrew from there, on a Kor\u010dulan galley commanded by a noble from Kor\u010dula, and were offered to the aforementioned church.&rdquo;<br />\r\nThe Crucifix had been mentioned before in the contemporary report of the local bishop Nikola Spani\u0107 (1673&ndash;1707), who during his visit to the church of All Saints (1699) mentioned that the &ldquo;Great Crucifix&rdquo; on the altar of Stss Rocco and Anthony had arrived from Candia (&ldquo;In ecclesia Omnium Sanctorum. In dicta Ecclesia ad altare S. Rochi e S. Antonii Abb. ubi est crux Magna translate de Candiae Regno 1668&rdquo; / &ldquo;In the church of All Saints. In the aforementioned church at the altar of St Rocco and St Anthony the Abba wherein a large Cross is located, transported from the Realm of Candia in 1668.&rdquo;) The reason these icons had been transferred to Kor\u010dula instead of Venice or the Ionian Islands, as was the case with the majority of the artworks recovered from Cretan churches, remains unclear. It is possible that Venice was intended as their final destination.<br />\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\n<p>This Crucifix offers one of the very few surviving examples of post-Byzantine iconostasis crownings, produced in the early 17th century Venetian Crete. The iconography of Christ reproduces the typical Venetian Trecento style. The whole synthesis, in terms of the classical figure of Christ and his serene expression, relies more on the paintings of Paolo Veneziano (1333&ndash;died 1358/62). For that reason, the artwork was considered, in the past, as an Italo-Cretan painting of the 14th or the 15th century, but at the same time, the linear design with the use of subtle vivid highlights, the color palette, and some iconographic details like the inscription in Greek lettering instead of Latin, link it to the Cretan icon-painting style of the 16th century.<br />\r\nThis skilful combination of elements of Italian and late Byzantine painting traditions undoubtedly reveals the work of a high-standing Cretan workshop. The comparison to the Crucifix at St. Catherine&rsquo;s monastery at Sinai, in terms of the body posture and form, the gentle facial features and the typology of the girdle, points directly to the manner of the Cretan painter Ieremias Palladas (1608&ndash;45).<br />\r\nIeremias, a Sinaitic monk in the dependency of Saint Catherine of Sinai in Candia (modern Heraklion), was a renowned teacher and painter, specializing in painted crosses and icons for iconostasis/templon. It appears that his precise design technique and the unique way in which he adopted iconographic themes, in-vogue during the 15th and 16th centuries, established him as a painter among the official ecclesiastical circles and led to a whole generation of painters that repeated his work.<br />\r\nThe greater part of his work on crucifixes for iconostasis has come down to us mainly from notarial documents in the archives of the Duca di Candia and Notai di Candia (State Archive of Venice). According to the written sources, he painted the cross and icons for some of the greatest pilgrimage churches of the Holy Land, such as the church of the Holy Sepulchre (1608), the monastery of St. Catherine at Mount Sinai (1612), the patriarchal church in Cairo (before 1631), and the church of the Nativity in Bethlehem (1639). In Candia, he executed the crucifixes for the iconostasis of the church of Panagia Trimartyre (before 1631) and for the dependency of St. Catherine of Sinai (before 1633).<br />\r\nGiven that these are the only painted crosses of Ieremias Palladas known to us from his works in Candia, it would not be entirely out of place to assume that the large Crucifix of Kor\u010dula adorned the iconostasis of one of these two churches. In accordance with the relevant documents, as well as the artistic maturity in terms of technique, compared to other works of the painter, the icon should be dated between the second and third decades of the 17th century, with the year 1633 serving as a <em>terminus ante quem </em>for its creation.<br />\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nRadi\u0107, F. &ldquo;Tri nadoltarska goti\u010dka kri\u017ea sa naslikanijem propec&eacute;m u riznici starodavne bratov&scaron;tine Svijeh Svetijeh u Kor\u010duli&rdquo;, <em>Vjesnik Arheolo&scaron;kog muzeja u Zagrebu </em>44:1 (1892), 111-118.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This is the first publication of the large Crucifix with reference to the parts that are missing.</p><p>Gamulin, Ggro. &ldquo;Italokre\u0107ani na Na&scaron;oj Obali&rdquo;, <em>Prilozi povijesti umjetnosti u Dalmaciji </em>16 (1966): 265-270.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">The article contains a detailed review of the Crucifix which is examined with a group of post-byzantine icons from the same region.</p><p>Gamulin, Ggro. <em>The Painted Crucifixes in Croatia</em>, Monumenta Artis Croatiae: First series, Zagreb 1983: 36-39, 124, cat.

The Despotate of Epirus, located in northwestern Greece, was situated in a mountainous area located between the Pindos Mountain range in the east and the Ionian Sea in the west. This geographical situation facilitated a degree of political separatism and independence from Constantinople and other political forces until the Ottoman conquest of the 15th century. When &ldquo;Epirus&rdquo; is mentioned there is a distinction between the old Epirus in the south, which consisted of Aitolia, Akarnania, Thesprotia and Ioannina, which were mainly Greek-speaking areas, and new Epirus in the north, Dyrrachium, and the western sections of Via Egnatia, which were mainly of Albanian descent and culture (as discussed further later).<br />\r\nThe power vacuum that was established in the region shortly after 1204 was exploited by local and foreign forces, with the most prominent example of Michael I Komenos Doukas (r. 1230-66/68) who ended up being the most successful political figure in the region and the founder of the state of Epirus in 1204. Ruling from the city of Arta, he quickly brought the surrounding regions throughout northwestern Greece and major parts of Thessaly on the east under his control. Michael never bore a title as a ruler, while there are no records from his rule that have survived. When he was murdered in 1214, his brother Theodore Komnenos Doukas (r. 1215-30) succeeded him as the ruler of Epirus. Theodore extended the state of Epirus to the north and east, while in 1224 he captured the city of Thessalonica. He was self-proclaimed emperor in 1225-26, and by 1227 he was crowned by archbishop Chomatenos (the archbishop that he had appointed) as emperor at Thessalonica. His coronation and his political interests beyond a regional empire directly challenged the emperors of Nicaea who claimed legitimacy as the true heirs to the imperial throne of the empire.<br />\r\nEmperor Theodore was captured and blinded by the Bulgarian ruler John Asen II (r. 1218-41) in 1230, while the state of Epirus survived in the region of Thessalonica under Thedodore&rsquo;s brother, Despot Manuel Angelos (r. 1230-37). In 1237, Theodore returned from Bulgaria, deposed Manuel, and placed his son John as emperor at Thessalonica. In 1242, John abdicated the throne and title to emperor John III Batatzes (r. 1222-54) from Nicaea, and he assumed the title of despot. In 1246, under despot Demetrios Angelos Doukas (r. 1244-46), Epirus lost the city of Thessalonica when it was captured and incorporated into the Nicaean Empire.<br />\r\nThe following ruler was Michael II Komnenos from ca. 1230-66/8, an illegitimate son of Michael I who ruled from the island of Corfu, and where under his leadership the rivalry between Epirus and Nicaea was reawakened. Michael II spread his control and power from Corfu to the mainland with his center being once again in Arta. There, from ca.1232 he ruled independently under the support of the prince of Achaia, Geoffrey II Villehardouin (r. 1229-46) and King Manfred of Sicily (r. 1258-66). The fear of a powerful Epirus with the connections and support from western forces led to a war between these three allied powers against the Empire of Nicaea. The alliance of the three lasted only until 1259, when with the battle at Pelagonia and the victory of the Nicaean forces under Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259-61), the armies of Nicaea extended their control over much of Epirus, with Michael II exiled in Cephalonia. This occupation was short and soon Michael II&rsquo;s sons were able to recapture their mainland holdings. In addition to this defeat, the Nicaean rulers were able to secure their claims as the legitimate rulers of the empire by capturing Constantinople in 1261 and thus securing their right and title of Emperor of the Romans.<br />\r\nFrom 1264 until 1318, Epirus was ruled by independent despots, while there was a relative time of peace between Epirus and the restored Byzantine Empire, with the emperor&rsquo;s hopes that the rulers of Epirus would forget their independence claims and return to the imperial fold. Thus far, all previous rulers of Epirus were viewed as rebels by the Nicaean rulers, while the Epirots themselves were not willing to let go of their independence and rejoin the empire. They instead went through extensive alliances with western Frankish and Latin forces and had to deal with foreign invasions and power struggles over the area. The last direct descendant of the family of Komnenos Doukas Angelos, which had created the Despotate of Epiros, was Despot Thomas (r. 1297-1318). Thomas was murdered in 1318 by his nephew Nicholas Orsini of Cephalonia, and his death signaled the end of a line of Byzantine descended rulers in Epirus. The despotate remained independent from Constantinople after that for many years, but its rulers would come from western European backgrounds.<br />\r\nBeginning in 1318, Epirus was ruled by the Italian Orsini family until ca. 1337, when local Epirot rulers with basilissa Anna and her son Nikephoros acting as leading political figures, tried to forge alliances with the Byzantine Empire. To their success, the lands of the despotate became parts of the Byzantine Empire under emperor Kantakouzenos by 1340.<br />\r\nWith the second Byzantine civil war (1341-47), Serbians and other foreign powers saw the opportunity to exploit the circumstances to their own advantage. Stephen Du&scaron;an of Serbia (r. 1346-55) in a series of conquests over northern Greece, was crowned in 1346 as &lsquo;emperor of the Serbs and Romans&rsquo;. By 1348, he had successfully conquered Epirus, and he had divided his Greek land possessions for two figures. Thessaly went to Gregory Preljub, and Epirus to Du&scaron;an&rsquo;s half-brother Symeon Uro&scaron;. At this point in Epirus, from 1359 to 1384, there were two major powers, the Serbian Despotate of Ioannina and the Albanian Despotate of Arta. An important figure from this period was ruler Thomas Komnenos Palaiologos or also known as Preljubovi\u0107 (son of Gregory Preljub), who ruled from Ioannina from 1366-84. Thomas was able to expand Serbian control over northern and southern Epirus against the Albanian forces, while after his death in 1384, his widow, the Byzantine Maria Angelina Doukaina Palaiologina, remarried the Italian nobleman Esau Buondelmonti and brought back an Italian restoration of the despotate. Esau ruled as Despote until 1411 when the despotate came under the house of the Italian family of Tocco that were able to hold the despotate until the subsequent conquest of Epirus by the Ottomans between 1430 and 1449.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nOut of the many issues and debates around the study of the Despotate of Epirus, this section briefly outlines three major points of discussion: 1. the lack of sources, 2. the question of the ethnic makeup of Epirus, and 3. the identity of Epirus after 1204.<br />\r\nFirst, one of the most significant issues around the study of the Despotate of Epirus in Late Byzantium is that of the lack of surviving sources, especially written ones from the despotate. Donald Nicol was one of the first scholars to point this issue out in his 1984 book <em>The Despotate of Epiros 1267-1479</em>. The major issue for the modern historian of Epirus, according to Nicol, was that not many documents survived that illuminate the administrative, social, or economic life of the despotate. Most written sources about the despotate come from Byzantine historians from Constantinople such as George Pachymeres (ca. 1242-1310), Nikephoros Gregoras (ca. 1295-1360), and John VI Kantakouzenos (ca. 1292-1383), who wrote about the Epirots as rebellious provincials. No historians&rsquo; work exists that provides the story from the side of the Epirots, besides the late 14th and 15th century chronicles of Tocco and Ioannina that provide informative details about the despotate, but which are also seen by today&rsquo;s scholars as the works of local patriots that cared about the positive outlook of the despotate. Documents that refer to the administration of Epirus derive primarily from imperial chrysobulls between secular and ecclesiastical powers such as the chrysobull of Kanina in 1307, and the chrysobulls of Ioannina in 1319 and 1321.<br />\r\nBeyond the written sources, modern scholars have engaged in research through a diverse collection of art and archaeology including surviving inscriptions on sites, seals, and hagiographic texts. Leonela Fundi\u0107 in her 2013 study &ldquo;Art and Political Ideology in the State of Epiros During the Reign of Theodore Doukas (r. 1215-30),&rdquo; looked at art through church dedications, frescoes, coins, and inscriptions, to better understand and analyze the political ideology and identity of the despotate. According to Fundi\u0107, artistic production in the despotate has been a poorly understood issue by the field. She sets out to reconstruct the political context of Epirot art during the period of Michael I and Theodore Komnenos Doukas, while also looking at art making in the despotate as an effective political instrument for the galvanization of new political ideologies and identities after 1204.<br />\r\nThe use of artistic and archaeological sources has added new levels of analysis on top of what the literary sources are able to tell us about the despotate and have allowed for a deeper on-the-ground understanding of socio-economic and political issues. For example, Fundi\u0107 points out the use of artistic patronage such as inscriptions that claim that the title of &ldquo;Emperor of the Romans&rdquo; belonged to the Doukas ruling family. This was done to support the political ambitions of the rulers of Epirus in their attempts to claim imperial succession after 1204.<br />\r\nAdditionally, the other major issue about the study of the despotate is the limited information and knowledge about the medieval provincial Byzantine society of Epirus. Many scholars of art history, archaeology, and beyond, such as Katerina Kontopanagou in &ldquo;Donor Portraits in the State of Epirus&rdquo; (2016), continue to explore new ways in which the study of artistic sources can answer parts of larger questions from the life of the despotate. This includes the functions and classification of the Epirot aristocracy through wall paintings in churches. The visual sources can also add more nuance to the questions of self-awareness, values, and ideology of the provincial life and political presence in the despotate. Such scholars understand the limitations of the literacy sources while studying Epirus, and they have employed new methods and source acquisition to be able to piece together new findings about the despotate, its people, and its social structure. Another bright example of this practice can also be seen in the work of Christos Stavrakos and his recent article titled &ldquo;Donors, Patrons, and Benefactors in Medieval Epirus Between the Great Empires&rdquo; (2021) where he primarily uses monuments and archaeological findings to study the development of the Despotate throughout the 14th and early 15th centuries and their various historical developments. The periods that he chose to study are largely based on sources such as monuments and archaeological findings, and he uses an array of glazed ceramics, and donor portraits through frescos found in churches and monasteries in order to piece together the historical narrative of 14th-16th centuries Epirus.<br />\r\nSecond, in the last few decades there has been an increasing interest in the study of ethnicity throughout the existence of the Byzantine Empire and most interestingly during the late Byzantine Empire after 1204; when Byzantine Roman identity faced new challenges and alterations. Brendan Osswald has been one of the most recent scholars to look at identity and ethnicity in medieval Epirus. In his 2018 study &ldquo;The Ethnic Composition of Medieval Epirus,&rdquo; Osswald looks at the ethnic diversity and the relationship between ethnic/national groups that lived in Epirus such as the Vlachs, Albanians, Serbs, but also the local and the Greek refugees in the area after 1204.<br />\r\nThe make-up of the Despotate of Epirus was that of a diverse mosaic of many ethnic groups that assimilated in one way or another within the physical and political borders. For example, during the 14th and 15th centuries, Epirus was faced with migrations of Albanian and Serbian groups that lived throughout Epirus and most of the times in their own isolated localities. In contrast, throughout the 12th and 13th centuries there was a great influx of Greek refugees from the east. Many of these refugees concentrated in the city of Ioannina, which became quite different from the capital city of Arta. During the 14th century, the cities of Ioannina and Arta represented two different political fields. Ioannina wanted reunification with the Byzantine Empire while Arta wanted to remain independent.<br />\r\nIn a political setting of perpetual conflict, Osswald surveyed the ethnic makeup of Epirus while at the same time raised the question of how much were the Romans (Greeks) of Epirus influenced socio-politically by the Byzantine elite from the east? His conclusion was that Byzantine elite presence was not dominant, but rather the elites of Epirus were informed by local and personal political opinions. Lastly, although the analysis of ethnic groups and political loyalties is important, the issue of sources and their political and social interests that they convey is a larger issue that scholars have been trying to analyze in order to understand how medieval Epirus functioned.<br />\r\nThird, beyond the ethnic makeup of Epirus, scholars have analyzed the identity stance of the rulers of Epirus, but also the political identity of the despotate. The rulers of the despotate attempted to protect their power from their Latin enemies, but at the same time maintain their independence from the rest of the Byzantine world. What scholars have argued is that Epirus was in a very special position between the west and the east. The identity of the rulers and of the despotate remained that of the Byzantine Orthodox sphere. Visual sources show an area where loyalty was fluid, sometimes adhering to the Latin allies and at others to the Byzantine customs. More recently, the interest for the study of space and its relationship with identity, introduced new ways of looking at the new identities that emerged after 1204 in Epirus, and which adhered to that special middle group that the despotate held for many years between west and east.<br />\r\nIn conclusion, some of the possible future avenues of research into the despotate include the furthering of the use and analysis of more frescos, paintings, archaeological findings, and inscriptions from churches and monasteries that have not yet been mapped out or considered widely by the field. Furthering the available sources will only create a more complete account and understanding of the despotate, its people, and its history. The other two avenues include the further study and consideration of ethnic identity, but also social/political/religious identity as a primary tool of analysis in order to study the people of Epirus and those that composed the political sphere of the despotate, and lastly using spatial and temporal tools of analysis in order to provide certain answers for the various questions about the functioning of the despotate as a geographical entity. It is certain that the ever-expanding field of mapping and spatial analysis has only started to look upon the area of Epirus in the Middle Ages, while more research on this kind is necessary in order to understand the history of the despotate with the new available sources that are provided to us via these new technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nFundi\u0107, Leonela. &ldquo;Art and Political Ideology in the State of Epiros during the Reign of Theodore Doukas (r. 1215-1230).&rdquo; <em>Byzantina Symmeikta</em> 23 (2013): 217&ndash;50. <u><strong><a href=\"https://ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr/index.php/bz/article/view/3810\">https://doi.org/10.12681/byzsym.1100</a></strong></u>.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">A really interesting study on the reconstruction of the political context of art-making in Epiros and the use and analysis of artistic and archaeological finds.

It investigates how people lived and interacted with each other, how they organized their built environment and how they conveyed important information about themselves, their community, and the world around them through their material culture and architecture. Ordinary people are at the heart of this project; we seek to better understand their living conditions, activities, and roles as city makers. In doing so, we pay special attention to the biography of houses and trace changes in their architecture, size, activities, and spatial organization. We are also interested in spaces where people met, interacted, and exchanged ideas, such as in streets, churches, open spaces, public benches and wells, shops, and burial sites.<br />\r\nAll archaeological and architectural evidence for this project comes from the Athenian Agora Excavations, a long-standing archaeological project in the heart of modern Athens (<strong><a href=\"http://agathe.gr/\">http://agathe.gr/</a></strong>). The Athenian Agora&rsquo;s archives provide a rich dataset including excavation notebooks, architectural plans, an extensive photographic record, and thousands of kept artifacts; we use this material to trace the history of Byzantine and Frankish Athens, reconstruct aspects of its built environment and explore the identities and socioeconomic and political activities of its citizens. We complement and enhance the existing archival records by reorganizing and reanalyzing information to serve this project&rsquo;s research agenda and period-specific focus, offering new interpretations and an overall new understanding of Byzantine Athens and its inhabitants.

    "text":"<p><em>By Alice Isabella Sullivan | Tufts University </em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nThe Virgin of Vladimir is a bilateral icon dating to the first half of the 12th century (ca. 1130). On one side, the icon shows an image of the Virgin Eleousa (or the Virgin of Tenderness) with the Christ Child. On the back, the icon features today an image of the Hetoimasia with the instruments of Christ&rsquo;s Passion nearby as a symbolic representation of the Second Coming. This side of the icon, however, was repainted; it originally displayed a saintly figure, possibly that of St. Nicholas.<br />\r\nThe style and iconography of the Virgin of Vladimir suggest a Byzantine origin, and more specifically the work of a Constantinopolitan atelier. The icon likely arrived in Kyiv as a diplomatic gift, underscoring the connection that extended between the Rusian and Byzantine cultural spheres following the Christianization of Rus in 988. From Kyiv, the icon was transferred to Suzdal and Vladimir, and then to Moscow in the 14th century, where it resided in the Dormition Cathedral and now in the State Tretyakov Gallery.<br />\r\nThe icon measures 106 x 69 cm in its current condition, but framing elements were added at a later point. The original image in the central composition measures 78 x 55 cm. Its size indicates that it was designed to be displayed inside a church, before the iconostasis near the altar area, and carried in religious processions. During such celebrations, both sides of the icon would have been visible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe Virgin Eleousa image type on the front of the icon shows a tender embrace between mother and child. The Christ Child reaches for his mother, touching his cheek to hers while extending his right arm around her mantle. The Virgin, in turn, gently cradles the child in her arms and bends her head to reach his cheek while looking out to the viewer. Her gaze is both loving and sorrowful, as if anticipating the suffering of her son&rsquo;s death. In locking eyes with the viewer, the Virgin also fulfills her intercessory role on the faithful&rsquo;s behalf.<br />\r\nThe Virgin of Vladimir is supposedly a miracle-working icon. It protected Moscow from military attacks during the 14th and 15th centuries, for example. It is known that on 25 August 1395, the icon was taken to Moscow to safeguard the city from Timur&rsquo;s army (r. 1370&ndash;1405). A century later, in 1480, the icon was once again brought to Moscow to ensure the city&rsquo;s protection, this time from the attacks of Khan Ahmed (r. 1465&ndash;81). Therefore, in times of need, the Virgin of Vladimir served as a palladium for Moscow, invoking divine protection and assistance from enemy attacks.<br />\r\nThe miraculous qualities of the original icon were transferred to the many copies that were created after it throughout the medieval and early modern periods. One of the oldest examples is the icon by Andrei Rublev (ca. 1360&ndash;ca. 1430), produced around the turn of the 15th century and residing now in the art museum in Vladimir.<br />\r\nOver time, the Virgin of Vladimir was further transformed through restorations and repaintings on both sides, as well as the addition of removable sections of precious metals, gemstones, and pearls. In the 15th century, the icon received a gold <em>oklad </em>(or revetment) for the area around the figures and the frame, consisting of 12 representations of holy feasts. In 1657, the icon also obtained an elaborate <em>riza</em> (embellishments for the figures), which further transformed its appearance. The latter consists of gold designs for the garments of the Virgin and Child, as well as elaborate jewel- and pearl-lined sections decorating the collars and haloes of the figures. The <em>riza</em> also added a crown to the figure of the Virgin, underscoring her role as the &lsquo;Queen of Heaven&rsquo;. Through these visual transformations, the Virgin of Vladimir acquired physical and spiritual value over time.<br />\r\nThe Virgin of Vladimir is one example that underscores the early contacts between Byzantium and Rus. Such contacts are reflected in political and economic alliances, such as the marriage of the Byzantine princess Anna Porphyrogenita (963&ndash;1011) to Volodimir I Sviatoslavich (r. 980&ndash;1015) in the year 989, soon after his conversion to Christianity. Other contacts are also evident in the religious and cultural spheres, including the design, building, and decoration of the Cathedral of St. Sophia in Kyiv according to Byzantine principles reworked in a local context.<br />\r\nYet, the early history and association of the Virgin of Vladimir with the city of Kyiv and Kyivan Rus have been bypassed in modern scholarship and the popular imagination. The icon&rsquo;s connections with Moscow and early modern Russia take center stage. The physical movement of the icon between Kyiv, Suzdal, Vladimir, and Moscow, however, corresponds with the transfer of religious, political, and ideological power, and its eventual concentration on the Kremlin in Moscow from the 14th century onward.<br />\r\nThis historical distortion is also reflected today in the numerous objects connected to Kyivan Rus that are now displayed in Russian museums, like the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. Others have been displayed in museums and private collections around the world. The history of the Virgin of Vladimir, like that of Kyivan Rus, should be examined through connections, and the multiplicity of meanings and transformations generated over time in evolving contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nAnisimov, Aleksandr Ivanovich. <em>Our Lady of Vladimir</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Nikolaos Thymakis | Agricultural Engineer MSc, Deputy Manager of Balkan Botanic Garden of Kroussia, PhD Candidate in Landscape Architecture, Politecnico di Milano (under the supervision of Prof. Neratzia Tzortzi) </em><br />\r\n<strong>Thematic Overview </strong><br />\r\nThe encroachment of the world relates to the planting of a garden, an image that expresses the creative character of apostasy. This consists of denying evil, with parallel care of the inner true man, until it becomes a divine temple. Gardens, meadows, and&nbsp;paradises can be integrated in the broadest sense into the philosophy of Byzantine society. In descriptions of gardens, there are several other features, like&nbsp;fountains (especially in Constantinople). These descriptions, combined with details of various buildings in Byzantine Chronography, offer insight into gardens in great urban centers and monasteries. Many scholars&nbsp;today study palace gardens such as &ldquo;Mesokipion&rdquo; and &ldquo;Maggana&rdquo;, medical texts, monastic estates, rural society, and agriculture in Byzantium. Conferences, Events, and Symposia relating to Byzantium have started to devote attention to Horticulture, Agriculture, and Gardens in general.<br />\r\nOne important factor in the study of medieval gardens is the location of a monastery or a church. This was usually focused on a source of water, like&nbsp;a natural spring, pond, or river. The water source could be diverted to various locations throughout the monastery to be used for cooking, bathing, and watering vegetation. Identifying&nbsp;a reliable source of water was an essential element for the self-sufficiency of monasteries, especially important for&nbsp;farming activities and product sufficiency. Perivolion, an edible garden, was (and still is to this day) a basic element of gardens in Byzantine monasteries.<br />\r\nSeveral types of gardens have been studied to date. It seems that ornamental gardens existed alongside fruit and vegetable gardens, in parks that enhanced&nbsp;the large towns; other&nbsp;gardens surrounded imperial palaces, residences of the aristocracy, and monasteries.<br />\r\nIt is, nevertheless, difficult to reconstruct or visualize these landscapes. Research on areas to&nbsp;the north of the Byzantine Empire (Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Croatia, Kosovo, etc.) offers valuable evidence on the topic. There are several Byzantine churches, serving either as active local chapels, churches, or monasteries, or are now in ruins, but with significant landscape and cultural impact in their area. Several of them are characterized as exceptional cultural heritage monuments (ICOMOS, EUROPA NOSTRA, UNESCO, CULTURAL ROUTES of COUNCIL OF EUROPE) and their gardens could be a part of the European Historic Gardens Network and some of them (maybe) in Historical Botanic Gardens Network.<br />\r\nThe sites (landscapes) of the monasteries have been selected based on their general ecological distinction in the ecosystems (environments) of the Byzantine Empire. The research seeks to uncover whether the criteria for the selection of sites (landscapes) correlate with ecozones and the blooming species mentioned in the Bible, and/or religious art through the centuries (pictures, paintings, photographs, browsers, descriptions, etc.).<br />\r\nSeveral key sites include:</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">-St. Ivan of Rila Monastery, Rila, Bulgaria</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">-Nativity of the Mother of God Monastery, Rozhen Monastery, Melnik, Bulgaria</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">-St. Ioannis the Theologian, Kaneo, Lake Orchid, North Macedonia</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">-Ephrasian Basilica-Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption of Mary, Porec, Croatia</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">-St. Joannikije of Devic, Devic, Kosovo.</p><p>These monasteries are treated as &ldquo;case studies&rdquo;. The research would have several parameters such as location, landscape context, lines, planting methodology, plants and vegetation, as well as&nbsp;biodiversity, watering systems, soil, and ecological consequences. Regarding the buildings, there are&nbsp;several references and reports concerning gates, the main church, guesthouses, cell wings, phiale, kiosks, and boathouses (if near the sea), etc. Details of ruins (paths, walls, walled gardens), remaining&nbsp;trees and plantings, as well as garden units can also be identified through this research, as are related art objects (paintings, mosaics), maps, and drawings. Finally, social, cultural, and daily life&nbsp;could be another source of research for&nbsp;cultivation traditions, including food production that included these gardens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nWe have very little information about the gardens of Byzantium. In almost all cases, no archaeological remains of gardens have&nbsp;been excavated. Most details about Byzantine gardens are preserved in historical sources. These include descriptions (&ldquo;ekphrases&rdquo;) of gardens in rhetorical and&nbsp;philosophical texts, such as novels or myths, as well as representations in monuments and artistic objects. Byzantine gardens have their own distinct characteristics and developed throughout the empire and in the decades after 1453.<br />\r\nToday, some bibliography and research on the topic of Byzantine Gardens has emerged, more organized in the last 30 years. This research&nbsp;describes types of product gardens, but also recreational gardens and&nbsp;imaginary or symbolic gardens.<br />\r\nByzantine Gardens were more than just gardens. The term &ldquo;garden&rdquo; has numerous meanings depending on the occupation of the person who was&nbsp;tending to it. Usually, a garden was&nbsp;associated with a region or a plot of land that was cultivated. &ldquo;The Garden&rdquo; was&nbsp;closely related with meditation, medication, the Eating Habits, the Bible, as well as other psychological, biological, and spiritual factors. Most of the previous research has primarily relied on Byzantine Rhythm in Architecture rather than in the landscape development that surrounded&nbsp;the building units. However, the documents that mention the garden scheme focus on the principles of the Byzantine Garden Design. Also, importance has been given to the symbolism of the plants and other elements included in gardens.<br />\r\nThere are specific links between monasteries in the Byzantine period and modern monastic communities&nbsp;through ecological &ldquo;models&rdquo; such as Botanical Gardens, Healing Gardens, Rural Landscapes with Traditional Farming techniques, and Symbolic Trees.<br />\r\nConsistent with these premises, the research focuses on&nbsp;Byzantine gardens as revealed&nbsp;through several sources, based on the few textual sources&nbsp;available for facts and data and specific case studies (monasteries and churches), as well as approaches that&nbsp;link the&nbsp;garden with religious, social, culture, topographica, and daily activities. The research also examines the impact of&nbsp;monasteries and churches with Byzantine gardens as urban landscapes developed around these sites. The model&nbsp;describes through a typology the thematic elements of the Byzantine Garden and their impact on daily life, as well as the connections with the surrounding or neighboring area and structures. The elements that transferred from the period of the 13th-17th century until today within&nbsp;the garden context of each monastery also contribute to the research.<br />\r\nThe literature review on this topic has been carried out according to different approaches, all useful to build a comprehensive picture:</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">i) a progressive collection of documents, selected for their relevance and analyzed in depth, which have allowed for a better framing of the problem. These are&nbsp;liturgical and holy texts, Byzantine art, and historical&nbsp;sources referring to Byzantine gardens and monastic rural areas. Horticulture/Botany and Landscape/Gardening resources are also&nbsp;included to support both the theoretical and practical dimensions of this research.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">ii) a structured research and literature review, based on keywords and several interviews with different fields scientists, specialists, and individuals closely related to the topic (theologists, byzantinologists, botanists, bandscape architects, paleographic experts, bishops, priests, monks) aimed at providing a qualitative overview of research trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>References</strong><br />\r\nDowney, G.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nicolas Mesarites: Descriptions of the Church of the Holy Apostles at Constantinople.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>Transactions of the American Philosophical Society</em> 47 (1957): 862&ndash;864.<br />\r\nBakke.

    "text":"<p><em>By Michail I. Asfentagakis | National and Kapodistrian University of Athens</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nThe monumental painting of the Post-Byzantine period on Symi Island, and specifically of the 16th and 17th century, is represented in two churches: the small (4.,79 x 2.,22 m.) church of St. Dimitrios tou Ambeliou (of the Vineyard) and the<em> katholikon</em> of the Monastery of Archangel Michael Kokkimidis. Both of them are located in the mountains of the island, with no great distance between them.<br />\r\nWe cannot be sure about the date of the erection of the church of St. Dimitrios, due to its simple architectural plan (one room building, with semi-circular roof, and holy bema with one semi-cylindered apse). In addition, it is covered by whitewash inside and outside and the examination of the walls is impossible so far. On the side walls of the naos, close to the templon, three depictions are still preserved, two in the north (enthroned <em>Pantokrator</em> and equestrian military saint, without hagionym) and one in the south (Panagia Vrefokratousa). Recently, the remaining frescoes were dated in the first half of the 16th century, perhaps in the first 30 years.<br />\r\nThe foundation of the Monastery of Kokkimidis is dated in the Protobyzantine Period, according to a contemporaneous engraved epigraph on the base of the present altar. The architectural style of the <em>katholikon</em> is the same as the one of St. Dimitrios, but larger in size (6.,28 x 2.,91 m.). On the lintel of the church an inscription survives, which mentions the renovation of the church by the hieromonk Callistratos in 1697. The whole iconographic program (almost) is preserved in a good condition and it is constituted of the depictions of the Deesis with hierarchs performing the Divine Liturgy, archangels, equestrian military saints, apostles, et al. The wall-paintings are dated at the end of the 17th century as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nAfter the surrender of Rhodes to the armies of Suleiman the Magnificent (1520 - 1566) and the withdrawal of the knights of the Order of St. John (1523), the two biggest islands of the Dodecanesian Complex, Rhodes and Kos, started facing a lot of difficulties in various sectors, especially due to the economic recession and the strict administration of the Ottomans. The painting production was significantly reduced and almost none of the frescoes in the churches of the Dodecanesian capital and Kos can be dated in the rest 77 years of the 16thth century. Although, the other islands of the Dodecanese, especially the smaller ones, like Symi, maintained their independence, it&rsquo;s not easy to detect iconographic programs from this period, apart from &ldquo;safe&rdquo; exceptions, e.g. in Panagia Spiliani in Aperi of Karpathos Island (1528, painter Iakovos Perkoudas or Perkoulas).<br />\r\nDuring the first quarter of the 16th century, before the siege of Rhodes, only specific churches of the island were decorated with new frescoes, like St. Nicholas in Trianta, Hagia Triada (Holy Trinity) in the Old Town (both between 1490 and 1510), St. Spyridon in the Old Town (second painting layer, second half of the 15th century or beginning of the 16th) and the<em> katholikon </em>of the Monastery of Archangel Michael in Thar(r)i (fourth painting phase, 1506). On Kos, frescoes from the first quarter of the 16th century are preserved only in a few churches. They are creations of a local painting workshop (active especially on Kos and Kalymnos Islands), whose artistic quality is pretty low.<br />\r\nIn the 17th century, the general situation on Rhodes has been normalized and the painting production has been increased, but not magnificently. Wall-paintings dated in this century are displayed in only ten churches on the island, according to their inscriptions. Also, on the other islands of the complex the examples are not many.<br />\r\nThe surviving frescoes in the church of St. Dimitrios tou Ambeliou consist a significant sample of the art of the 16th century in the Dodecanese, no matter if they are dated some years before 1523 or after. They were painted by an experienced painter, with a good knowledge in monumental painting and icon painting as well, and they are not connected to any other artwork, on Rhodes, Kos or other islands. We can&rsquo;t be sure from which artworks he inspired his patterns, but similarities between his work in St. Dimitrios and pieces of art of the eclectic style from Rhodes to Cyprus probably show us the contact he had with Western masterpieces (e.g. the portable icon <em>Christ Carrying the Cross</em> in the Collection of the Rhodes Bishopric, ca. 1500). Certainly, portable icons influenced his art and the presence of the stylistic features of the Cretan School are pretty obvious. His origin is still unknown and we can&rsquo;t be sure if the painter belonged to a local workshop or he was a traveling artist. Many Cretan icons have been detected in the Dodecanesian Complex and, from the Notarial Archives, we know that Cretan artists were invited later, at the beginning of the 17th century, to decorate churches in the Dodecanese. The creator of the frescoes in St. Dimitrios tou Ambeliou could be one of them.<br />\r\nAs concerns the <em>katholikon</em> of Kokkimidis Monastery, the importance of the monument is based, not only on the inscription of the <em>ktitor</em>, which informs us about the erection of the new building, but also on the fact that the <em>katholikon</em> is the only church on the island with wall-paintings dated safely in the 17th century. Its decoration gives us valuable information about the iconographic choices of the patron, the painting style of the painter and consequently of the last period of the 17th century in the Dodecanese (only a few frescoes are dated then). The great, half-destroyed, depiction of Sts. Peter and Paul on the west wall, instead of the theme of the Last Judgment, is remarkable, as it reveals the special connection between the patron of the <em>katholikon</em> and the Republic of Venice (<em>La Seren&igrave;sima</em>). Of course, the diplomatic relations between Symi and the Republic were already known through a letter which was sent by Doge Francesco Morosini (1688 - 1694) to the Symians in 1684 (the hieromonk Ananias from the Symian Monastery of the Archangel Michael Roukouniotis had met him earlier in Preveza, before Morosini became a Doge).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nAsfentagakis, Michail I. &ldquo;The Wall-Paintings of the Church of the Archangel Michael Kokkimidis.

    "text":"<p><em>By Michail I. Asfentagakis </em>|<em> National and Kapodistrian University of Athens</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nFour churches of Symi preserve frescoes from the 13th century and the Knights Hospitaller Period (1308&ndash;-1523) in the Dodecanesian complex of islands. These are St. Ioannis tis Tsagrias, St. Marina tis Neras, St. Prokopios and the old <em>katholikon</em> of the Monastery of Archangel Michael Roukouniotis. The monuments were unpublished until 2021, but their wall-paintings were well-known to the local scientific community. They have also been mentioned in several studies but without any analysis.<br />\r\nThe small church of St. Ioannis tis Tsagrias is built on the mountains, far from the<em> chora </em>(capital) of the island. Its architectural plan is simple, as the whole building is constituted of the naos and the holy bema (with one semi-cylindered apse), covered by a semi-circular roof (4.70 x 2.00 m). Only a few depictions, from the Christological Cycle (<em>the Transfiguration of Jesus, the Betrayal of Jesus, the Crucifixion of Christ. The Entry into Jerusalem and probably the Last Supper</em>), are still preserved on the north and south walls of the naos and they likely date to 1270&ndash;80.<br />\r\nSt. Marina tis Neras is built very close to the Monastery of Sotiris o Megalos (Saviour the Great), not far from St. Ioannis. Its architectural style is the same as the one of Tsagria church (5.88 x 2.81 m), but in this monument almost the whole iconographic program is still visible in the interior. Two dedicatory inscriptions are preserved on the semi-cylinder of the apse of the holy bema and only one scene, next to the prothesis, from the iconographic cycle of St. Marina survives. The frescoes have been recently dated to the first half of the 14th century.<br />\r\nThe church of St. Prokopios follows the same architectural style as the other two (6.25 x 2.69 m), but its iconographic program is the most interesting, compared to the other byzantine churches of the island, especially because of its unique in byzantine monumental painting iconographic cycle of St. Prokopios. The frescoes were recently dated in ca. 1380.<br />\r\nThe Monastery of Archangel Michael Roukouniotis constitutes one of the most important foundations in the Dodecanese. Inside the old <em>katholikon</em>, a free cross church, with dome and narthex (14.65 x 5.50 m), frescoes from two different chronological periods are preserved. From the first (byzantine) phase only the depiction of St. Lawrence survives and it is dated in ca. 1450. All the other iconographic themes are dated, perhaps, in the 17th century, but they haven&rsquo;t been examined thoroughly yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe majority of the evidence we have for the monumental painting in the Dodecanese during the Knights Hospitaller Period concerns mainly Rhodes, as the spiritual and cultural center of the complex. Even the other big islands, like Kos, do not have, so far, so much information to offer about the local artistic activity, apart from some exceptions of course. About the smaller islands of the Dodecanese, things are even worse, since many of the monuments there remain unpublished. The Ph.D. thesis of Th. Archontopoulos (2003), M. Sigala (2011), K. Kefala (2012) and M. Asfentagakis (2021) lightens somehow the unknown aspects of the activity of the painters in the churches of Rhodes, Chalke and Symi (basically) from the 13th century until the withdrawal of the Hospitallers in 1523.<br />\r\nThe church of St. Ioannis tis Tsagkrias constitutes the only monument on Symi, which is decorated with frescoes dated in the second half of the 13th century. Also, the wall-paintings of the second painting phase of St. Georgios o Kylindriotis, on Symi as well, are dated in around 1200, but we cannot be sure if they were made at the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the subsequent one. Not many depictions are preserved and we can&rsquo;t have a global view of the iconographic program of the church. However, some observations about the painter and his style could be made. He is a capable painter and his work is a bit conservative, with some visible late-Comnenian features. An important remark concerns the similarities between the depictions of St. Ioannis and many artworks from the same period in Cyprus, as maybe show us an artist from Cyprus, or a Dodecanesian one, who had some contact with Cypriot creations, especially portable icons, and he was influenced by them.<br />\r\nSt. Marina tis Neras and St. Prokopios are the only churches on the island with decoration dated in the 14th century, after the occupation of the Dodecanese (1308). The quality of the art of the frescoes in St. Marina is medium (several times the drawings of the depictions are not well-made, the size of the figures is not always balanced, etc.) but there are some really interesting and remarkable details in iconography and style. It&rsquo;s worthy to mention the rare iconographic cycle of St. Marina (just one scene is preserved today, the <em>Interrogation of Prefect Olyvrios</em>), which is the only one in the Dodecanesian Complex, as well as the figure of Prophet Daniel in the scene of the Anastasis (Resurrection of Jesus). As we know from the published monuments, so far, the prophet does not appear in any other depiction of the Descent into Limbo in byzantine art. We suppose that the role of Ioannis, who was priest and nomikos (jurist), according to the inscriptions in the holy bema, was catalytic in the formation of the iconographic program. He and his wife, presvytera (priest&rsquo;s wife) Maria, were the people behind the patronage, but, as one of the inscriptions show us, probably Ioannis did not stay alive until the end of the work.<br />\r\nIn St. Prokopios, not only the quality of the art of the frescoes, but also the iconographic choices of the patron and/ or the painter are really notable. First of all, the iconographic cycle of the homonymous saint is unique, as it is the only one which is still preserved in the Byzantine monumental painting, as well as the depiction of the equestrian St. Prokopios. The iconographic program of the church shows us a well-educated and wealthy, probably Symian, male patron, who had connections with the Grand Master&rsquo;s court. Parts of the iconographic program in the holy bema and naos reflect his desire for protection and salvation, whilst some others &ldquo;betray&rdquo; the respect he had to the Order of Saint John. An important remark concerns the depiction of the Anastasis, where some details, like the shiny dress of Jesus and the unique bright sheepskin of St. John the Forerunner, possibly indicate the influence of Hesychasm, chiefly, on the society of Rhodes (we assume that the painter came to decorate the church from the capital of the complex).<br />\r\nAs concerns the old <em>katholikon</em> of Roukouniotis Monastery, the well-preserved depiction of St. Lawrence gives us valuable information about the high quality level of the art of the workshop which decorated the interior of the church. The coat-of-arms where is detected in front of the north entrance of the <em>katholikon</em> clearly indicates the significant role of the Hospitallers in the decoration (and maybe in the erection) of the church. The combination of some gothic elements in the architecture of the building and the figure of St. Lawrence, who is a popular saint of the Catholic Church, possibly reflects the Knights as the main funders of the work which took place in the monastery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nArchontopoulos, Theodoros A. <em>The Church of St. Aikaterini in the Old Town of Rhodes and the Painting of the Late-Medieval Period in the Dodecanese</em> (in Greek).

    "text":"<p><em>By Nikola Piperski</em> | <em>Research Associate, Department of Art History, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Belgrade, Serbia </em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nThe Monastery of Kru&scaron;edol, is a Serbian Orthodox monastery on Fru&scaron;ka Gora Mountain, in Syrmia, Serbia, province of Vojvodina. It is dedicated to the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The monastery is the legacy of the last titular Orthodox Serbian despots in Hungary - the holy despots Brankovi\u0107. The monastery was erected beginning in 1509 with support from St. Angelina Brankovi\u0107 of Serbia (ca. 1440&ndash;1520), and additional the financial support from the Grand Prince Vasili III of Russia (r. 1505&ndash;33). Initially, the monastery was founded as the mausoleum for the Brankovi\u0107 family.<br />\r\nThe original purpose of the monastery was changed in 1512, when St. Maxim (1461&ndash;1516), a former Serbian Despot \u0110or\u0111e Brankovi\u0107 (r. 1486&ndash;97), became the Metropolitan of Belgrade (1512&ndash;16). With the financial help of the voivode of Wallachia Neagoe Basarab (r. 1459&ndash;1521), Maxim continued the work on the construction of the monastery, which had started under his mother. The building continued not only as it was first intended, as a family mausoleum, but also as a new seat of the Metropolitanate of Belgrade. This was significant because at that time the city of Belgrade was in danger due to the threat of the Ottoman invasion.<br />\r\nThe Monastery of Kru&scaron;edol was founded in the Kingdom of Hungary, just before its demise at the battle of Moh&aacute;cs (1526). For the next two centuries, the monastery functioned within the political framework of the Ottoman Empire and its cultural model. The cults of the holy despots established the idea of Kru&scaron;edol as the leading spiritual center of the Orthodox Serbs in the areas north of the rivers Sava and the Danube. Kru&scaron;edol retained that status even after the region became part of the Habsburg monarchy at the end of the 17th century. In 1708, it became the seat of the Metropolitanate of Kru&scaron;edol (which moved in 1713 to Sremski Karlovci). The Metropolitanate of Karlovci was elevated to the Patriarchate of Karlovci in 1848. In 1920, it was merged with the Metropolitanate of Belgrade and other Eastern Orthodox jurisdictions in the newly established kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes to form the Serbian Orthodox Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nAlthough the relics were burnt during one Turkish intrusion in 1716, the cult of the holy despots persisted. Over time, Kru&scaron;edol was gradually transformed from the mausoleum of the holy despots into the museum of Serbian archbishops and patriarchs. The Patriarchs who were buried in the monastery were Arsenije III \u010carnojevi\u0107 (1674&ndash;90) and Arsenije IV Jovanovi\u0107 &Scaron;akabenta (1725&ndash; 37). Graves of other historical figures include count \u0110or\u0111e Brankovi\u0107 (no connection to the Brankovi\u0107 family) (1645&ndash;1711), p rincess Ljubica Obrenovi\u0107 (18171&ndash;39), the wife of the Serbian Prince Milo&scaron; Obrenovi\u0107 (Grand Vo\u017ed of Serbia (1815&ndash;17); prince of Serbia (1817&ndash;39) and (1858&ndash;60), the Serbian king Milan Obrenovi\u0107 (prince of Serbia 18681&ndash;82 and king 1882&ndash; 89). Because of this during the last decades of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, Kru&scaron;edol was regarded as the Serbian national pantheon.<br />\r\nKru&scaron;edol is also famous for its cultural and artistic heritage, icon collection, and a large library. The monastery was severely damaged during WWII, when a big part of its treasures was lost. Today, many artifacts from the monastery are kept in the Museum of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade.<br />\r\nThe strongest architectural character of the church and the overall appearance of the monastery, as it is today, emerged after the renovation in the middle of the 18th century, but the basic idea of the design of the original church can be reconstructed, and partially seen today. The first church building was built as a triconch church with a dome over the naos and a large narthex extending to the west. According to most researchers, this type of church originated from Mount Athos, and was widely used in the Serbian Late Middle Ages (ca. 1370&ndash;1459), become especially characteristic of the churches of the so-called Morava School.<br />\r\nWhat distinguishes Kru&scaron;edol church from the churches of the Morava School is the absence of the decorative stonework of the facades, evident in other churches from this period. The main church of Kru&scaron;edol was built of stone and brick, and then plastered. The simplicity of its facades makes Kru&scaron;edol more similar to the early Renaissance churches that were erected throughout Pannonia during the reign of Matthias Corvinus (regnal dates). According to Abbot Bonini who visited Kru&scaron;edol 1702, the monastery church at the time was decorated with frescoes inside and out. Based on that that one can assume that the church was originally decorated on the outside and inside with frescoes in the Greek (Byzantine) manner.<br />\r\nAt the beginning of the 1740s, a general renovation of the church took place, in the spirit of &ldquo;Baroque Classicism. &rdquo;At the time, the altar apse was significantly expanded, the passage between the nave and the narthex was widened, and a new porch was built on the west side of the church. This redesign emphasized the linearity of the church, which gained a total of 3 m in length. This expansion can be seen from the perspective of the increasingly pronounced tendency to give the liturgy a ceremonial character in the 18th century. The number of participants in the liturgical drama was increasing, which formally required both a larger congregation and a larger altar space.<br />\r\nThe wall paintings of the church of Kru&scaron;edol were created between the middle of the 16th and the middle of the 18th century. Today, the original painting of the narthex, which dates to 1543, and those of the naos, dating to 1545, can only be partially seen. The majority of the original frescoes have been covered with the newer ones from the 18th century. The original painting of the narthex is known only from the parts discovered during the conservation in 1962, when a layer of later painting up to 170 cm high was removed in the lowest zone. Then the painted plinth and the lower part of the standing figures of the first belt became visible. Among the standing figures, one can recognize the figures of Christ, the Mother of God, Barlaam and Josaphat, St. Sava Nemanji\u0107, St. Simeon Nemanja, holy kings of the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty, Maxim Brankovi\u0107, his mother Angelina and brothers Jovan and Stefan. The original painting can also be seen to some extent on the upper parts of the walls. Ecumenical councils were painted above the standing figures, and above them is a belt of medallions with waist-length figures of saints. The rest of the original program is unknown, but based on remaining of the painted borders above the circular medallions it can be assumed that on the north and south walls there were 12 compositions of the Akathist cycle.<br />\r\nIn the nave, thanks to conservation interventions, a significantly larger area of \u200b\u200bthe original painting was discovered than in the narthex. Unfortunately, the discovered parts do not provide a basis for a complete overview of the thematic repertoire. One can only see that in the lowest zone, in addition to the figures of monks and hermits, holy warriors also appear, and that in the upper zone, the cycle of the Feasts of Jesus Christ was arranged, from which only the scene of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary can be seen on the western wall. It is noticeable that in very visible places on the sub-dome columns there are images of St. Sava, St. Simeon and St. Maxim.<br />\r\nThe frescoes on the western porch (1650&ndash;66) of which the monumental representation of the Last Judgment is best preserved, are executed in the late Byzantine manner, typical for frescoes in Serbian churches created during the Ottoman rule.<br />\r\nThe re-painting of the main church of Kru&scaron;edol took place around the middle of the 18th century, when the Baroque understanding of church painting in the Metropolitanate of Karlovci was already largely accepted. The work was entrusted to the workshops of Jov Vasilijevi\u010d (ca. 1700&ndash; after 1760) and Stefan Tenecki (ca. 1720&ndash;98), the best educated and most respected artists of the Metropolitanate of Karlovci at the time. The first artist was of a Ukrainian origin, and the second a pupil of the painting school of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. Moreover, the Gate Church of the Trinity (Pechersk Lavra) monastery, whose painting is often compared to the one of Kru&scaron;edol, was most certainly well known to the two artists. Therefore, their work in Kru&scaron;edol Monastery in Syrmia attests to the necessity for further investigation in order to grasp a better insight into the complex artistic and cultural connections in the regions to the north and south of the Danube River.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nDavidov, Dinko. <em>Kru&scaron;edol</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>Kristel Markus-Ven&auml;l&auml;inen</em> | <em>Doctoral researcher, University of Helsinki</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nSt. John&rsquo;s church (Estonian: <em>Jaani kirik</em>) is a medieval church in Tartu, in modern Estonia, dedicated to St. John the Baptist. The oldest parts of the church date to the 14th century, but the church has been rebuilt several times over the years due to damages caused by numerous wars and fires. Today, it is a three-aisled basilica with one-aisled choir, a big western tower, a sacristy on the north side, and chapels on the southern side. Once the church had approximately 2000 terracotta figures, each modeled individually, which depicted besides Christian iconography also fantastic creatures, foliage and figures of non-religious nature. The large number of the terracotta figures and their artistic execution make them unique in the context of medieval art in Europe.<br />\r\nThe exact construction time of the church is unknown, since written sources from that time are scarce. Nevertheless, it is clear that the construction evolved in several stages and began with the erection of the choir during the first quarter of the 14th century. Dendro-chronological analysis of wooden rafts, on which the church foundations are erected, indicates that the construction of the nave began around 1321. Several other methods for dating have been used, such as stylistic analysis, as well as comparisons with other medieval churches nearby and elsewhere in Europe. The fashion of hairstyles and headdresses (such as <em>kruseler</em>) of the surviving sculptures have also been an important source for the dating of the site.<br />\r\nSt. John&rsquo;s church is an important landmark, and its architecture speaks also for the history of Tartu. Tartu belonged to the Hanseatic League (medieval trade union joining market towns and merchants mainly around the North and Baltic Sea regions), and the trade route between East (Novgorod-Pskov) and Western Europe passed through it. It is probable that at least partly the construction of the church was initiated by the (foreign) merchants &ndash; the fact that one of the church&rsquo;s medieval chapels is named in historical records as L&uuml;beck chapel indicates this possibility. Also, Brick Gothic architecture was widely spread especially in the towns of the Hanseatic League.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nThe most significant aspect about St. John&rsquo;s church is its rich sculptural program, which in the church&rsquo;s heyday consisted of around 2000 terracotta figures. Approximately half of them have survived to this day. Numerous wars, such as the Great Northern War (1700&ndash;1721) and World War II (1939&ndash;1945), have wrecked the church and left the sculptural program fragmented. Ironically, the biggest harm was caused by the 19th-century architects and the ideals of their time: in the 1820s and 1830s, the choir and nave of the church were reconstructed according to the spirit of classical architecture. In order to re-design the church, medieval-looking sculptures were simply cut off and destroyed. Fortunately, the figures in the niches of the triforium zone and on the columns were simply covered with plaster, which secured their existence.<br />\r\nTerracotta or fired clay, distinctive for its reddish-brownish color, was a known material in medieval Europe, but its use remained rather marginal. Best equivalents to St. John&rsquo;s church can be found for instance in northern Germany, where extensive use of terracotta sculpture can be explained by the lack of natural stone (see Chorin Abbey, St. Mary&rsquo;s church in Rostock, St. Mary Magdalene&rsquo;s church in Eberswalde, Ebstorf Abbey &ndash; all from the 13th and 14th centuries). Drawsko Pomorskie church (14th century), Orneta church (14th/15th centuries), and Malbrok Castle (13th century) in modern Poland also offer comparisons. Hattula church (15th century) in Finland with its two terracotta heads is geographically the nearest example of the use of terracotta to St. John&rsquo;s church.<br />\r\nThe technology that was employed in making terracotta figures varies in each site. Most often modeling or molds were used, the latter was a quicker solution that allowed to &ldquo;mass-produce&rdquo; the figures. But in St. John&rsquo;s church stonemasons have cut and carved the figures out from larger blocks of clay, a method more characteristic to the making of wood and stone sculptures. Therefore, each figure out of the 2000 was one of a kind. Stylistic analysis has shown that several sculptors were working on the site, whose expertise and mastery varied. Furthermore, St. John&rsquo;s figures are also striking due to their large size; many sculptures were made of several (up to five) blocks that were united after firing.<br />\r\nThe whole process was difficult, time-consuming, and expensive: first the clay blocks were made, then the sculpture was carved, after which the drying and firing process followed. Firing in the wood-fired oven took around two weeks; the whole process of making one figure might have taken months. The bigger the figure, the longer the process lasted. Terracotta figures also tend to crack easily during the firing process if right temperature is not established.<br />\r\nAs approximately half of the sculptures are destroyed or missing, many survived in fragments and the location of all the survived figures is unsure, it is difficult to reconstruct the whole iconographic program of St. John&rsquo;s church. Furthermore, instead of using classical attributes, many figures have had scrolls with explanatory inscription. Unfortunately, the text from the scrolls has vanished, as well as the original polychrome of the figures. Nevertheless, the Last Judgement theme seems to have been the dominant one. For instance, the west portal&rsquo;s pediment is crowned by Christ in Majesty, depicted in a mandorla, and followed by the kneeling Virgin Mary, St. John the Baptist, and the twelve apostles. It forms a representation of the De&euml;sis, which as an image type originates in the Eastern Christian context.<br />\r\nMoreover, in the interior, Christ as Judge can be found from the western wall of the nave; the bosses from the vaults have depicted four apocalyptic creatures and the Lamb of God (<em>Agnus Dei</em>); and crowned figures with scepters sitting under the sculpted baldachins in the pseudo-triforium zone represented the elders of the Apocalypse. The Crucifixion group with life-sized figures of Jesus on the cross and standing figures of Virgin Mary and St. John the Baptist that once stood in the wall niche above the triumphal arch are also noteworthy.<br />\r\nThere are, however, a lot of sculptures that still are waiting further studies and explanations. For example, the fantastic creatures and foliage from the blocks surrounding the pillars. Moreover, some of the unidentifiable human figures could have been individuals with secular backgrounds, perhaps including patrons. The gallery of different human heads also expresses individuality: different hairstyles and headwear were used, some faces have beards, others are clean-shaven. Art historians have seen those heads as representations of different medieval social classes.<br />\r\nDuring the conservation of surviving terracotta sculptures the research has largely been focused on the materiality and technique of the latter, while the original meanings and functions of these figures are still vague. The main questions have remained unanswered: who were depicted on those sculptures and why did St. John&rsquo;s church have such a rich figural program? The scarcity of written sources and state of the figures (lack of attributes) had not made it an easy task for the art historians. Medieval sacral architecture containing terracotta sculptures from Northern and Central Europe have so far offered good comparisons to St. John&rsquo;s church, but comparative analysis based on the subject matter might offer new results. Therefore, another medieval site with sculptural program depicting representations of different estates of the realm need to be found.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nAlttoa, Kaur, Eve Alttoa, Krista Kodres, and Anu M&auml;nd. 2011. <em>Tartu Jaani Kirik (=St. John&#39;s Church in Tartu)</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Octavian-Adrian Negoi\u021b\u0103 | Institute for the History of Religions, Romanian Academy </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Historical Overview </strong><br />\r\nThe Patriarchate of Constantinople is one of the most influential and enduring institutions of Eastern Christianity. After Emperor Constantine I (r. 324&ndash;37) transferred the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to Constantinople, the episcopal seat founded here gradually gained prominence in the Christian world. Its bishop received the title of patriarch in 451 at the Synod of Chalcedon, and soon after Constantinople became one of the Church Seats that formed the Pentarchy along with Jerusalem, Antioch, Rome and Alexandria. The highest forum of decision of the Patriarchate was the permanent synod (<em>synodos end\u0113mousa</em>), presided over by the patriarch. Over the centuries, the patriarchs of Constantinople were involved in the religious debates that shaped the Orthodox faith and its dogma, and forged ecclesiastical and political diplomatic relations with other institutions from both East and West. Besides the dioceses that were under its ecclesiastical control (whose number changed over time), the Patriarchate developed an impressive network of monasteries that were directly under its jurisdiction (<em>stauropegias</em>) and had annual fiscal duties to it. During the early modern period, this network stretched from the Christian East to Russia via the Balkans and the Danubian Principalities. Moreover, the Patriarchate played a crucial role in the political and ecclesiastical affairs of Byzantium and, after its fall, well beyond in the Orthodox world.<br />\r\nIn Byzantium, the complex and often complicated relationship between the patriarch and the emperor proved to be quite different from what stipulated the concept of &ldquo;the Byzantine symphony&rdquo; (i.e., the harmonious collaboration between the State and the Church) articulated by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (r. 527&ndash;65). Nevertheless, the close connection between the two political actors existed; for instance, the patriarch was deeply involved in the ritual of the emperor&rsquo;s enthronement, while the other had decisional power in the patriarch&rsquo;s appointment. But after 1453, when the patriarchate was reinstated by the sultan Mehmet II (r. 1444&ndash;46 and 1451&ndash;81), the relationship between the Greek Orthodox patriarch and the Ottoman administration became even more complicated, the patriarchs and, by extension, the institution itself had to adapt and configure its policies according to the political context. As a visual representation of the Patriarchate&rsquo;s duties towards its subjects, it can be noted that since the 1980s the modern flag of both the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and Mount Athos features a double-headed eagle, which in its right claw holds a cross and in the other an orb, symbolizing the divine and secular authority. Moreover, an emblem presenting the same eagle is today placed above the main entrance of the Patriarchal Cathedral of St George in Istanbul.<br />\r\nSince its beginnings in the fourth century, the Patriarchate&rsquo;s life intertwined with the history of Constantinople, but the situation changed dramatically in 1204, in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade and the sack of the city by the Latins. The Greek patriarchs followed the Byzantine administration into exile to Nicaea, and installed their headquarters in the premises of the Hagia Sophia Church, from where they conducted the Patriarchate&rsquo;s affairs. This affected the Patriarchate&rsquo;s authority among other ecclesiastical institutions, as, for instance, the Serbian Kingdom founded its own autonomous patriarchate at Pe\u0107 in the fourteenth century. This situation changed in 1261, when Emperor Michael VIII (r. 1261&ndash;82) took back the city from the Latins, and the Patriarchate resumed its former location and gained substantial power. Among the most prominent ecclesiastical events that took place during the last centuries of Byzantium and involved the Patriarchate and its leaders are the Union of the Churches and the Hesychast controversy. In 1274, a Byzantine delegation participated at the Second Council of Lyon, which was convened by Pope Gregory X (c. 1210&ndash;76) after he received assurances from the emperor Michael VIII himself that the Byzantines decided to unite with the Church of Rome in order to stop any anti-Byzantine initiative that might have been initiated by a Western power. Later, due to the Ottoman threat over the Byzantine territories, the Greek Church turned again towards Rome for military and financial aid, for which discussed again the possibility of a union between the two Churches at the Council of Ferrara-Florence (1438&ndash;39), whose decisions had deep repercussions within the Orthodox world until modern times. Lastly, the adoption of Hesychasm promoted by the Archbishop of Thessaloniki Gregory Palamas (1296&ndash;1359) in the fourteenth century as the official dogma of the Orthodox Church put an end to a period of theological controversies that divided the Byzantine society during the Palaiologan period.<br />\r\nIn 1453, Constantinople fell under the Ottomans, but the Patriarchate continued its existence, being subsequently restored by Sultan Mehmet II, who appointed the Greek monk Georgios Gennadios II Scholarios (c. 1400&ndash;73) as patriarch. The reasons for this political decision are diverse: the Sultan&rsquo;s desire to repopulate Constantinople and transform it into his capital city, and that Scholarios was the leader of the Orthodox anti-Latin party that was active in Constantinople during the last years of Byzantium, which made him the ideal candidate given the sultan&rsquo;s plans for Europe. Scholarios appointment was ratified through an official document (<em>berat</em>), which stipulated his prerogatives (i.e., authority over the clergy, management of the Church&rsquo;s properties, application of the Byzantine law to the members of the Greek Orthodox group, and the right to collect taxes) that are encountered also in the appointment diplomas of the future patriarchs. Although the Patriarchate initially received the Church of the Holy Apostles as headquarters after 1453, the situation changed quickly, as the Pammakaristos Church (Fethiye Camii since 1591) took first its place and then the Church of Saint George from the Phanar neighborhood became the patriarch&rsquo;s residence, and, at the same time, the center of the Greek Orthodox elites of Constantinople. In the eyes of the Ottoman administration, the status of the patriarch was that of an Ottoman prelate, bestowed with authority over the Greek Orthodox community (<em>t\u0101&rsquo;ife</em>) and was in charge of collecting taxes (<em>m&uuml;ltezim</em>) for the Porte. This status quo also affected the succession and election of patriarchs. The competing claims over bishops and metropolitans backed by various Christian and non-Christian groups, alongside the financial burdens that overwhelmed both Christian laymen and clergy, but agreed with the Ottoman policies, very often changed the leadership in the Patriarchate.<br />\r\nBesides the political instability, the patriarchs of Constantinople continued to engage in ecclesiastical relations with the Catholic and Protestant West (e.g., the theological correspondence between the Ecumenical Patriarch Jeremias II and the T&uuml;bingen theologians), as well as with the Eastern Patriarchates. Moreover, renowned monastic communities, such as Mount Athos and Sinai remained in a constant connection with the Patriarchate, although their history witnessed also episodes of tension between the patriarchs and the monastic leaders (e.g. the Kollyvades movement that begun in Athos during the second half of the eighteenth century). In the Balkans and the Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, the patriarchs of Constantinople managed to cast a significant influence, being involved in the election of metropolitans and the religious life of the Orthodox world by developing close relations with the voivodes. For instance, in 1359 Patriarch Kallistos I (1350&ndash;53 and 1355&ndash;63) appointed the Greek monk Yakinthos of Vicina (1359&ndash;72) as the first metropolitan of Ungro-Wallachia, while in 1645, at the request of the patriarch, Lord of Moldavia Basil Lupu (r. 1634&ndash;53) corresponded with the Russian Tzar Mihail Fedorovici (r. 1613&ndash;45) whom he asked for financial aid to help the Patriarchate&rsquo;s financial situation. Moreover, many patriarchs left a distinctive mark on the religious life and the intellectual history of Eastern Christian communities from the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe through their works, printing activities, preaching, learning, and impressive libraries. During the Ottoman period, the Patriarchal Academy of Phanar became a crucial place of learning that instructed future illustrious members of the Church or the Phanariot families. It is here where the neo-Aristotelian philosopher Theophilos Korydallefs (1563&ndash;1646), appointed director of the Academy by the notorious Patriarch Kyrillos Loukaris (1572&ndash;1638), developed his neo-Aristotelian philosophical method of interpretation, known as Korydalism. As such, the Patriarchate of Constantinople has always played a vital role in the life of the Orthodox communities and the articulation of their beliefs along the centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates </strong><br />\r\nAlthough the studies on the Patriarchate of Constantinople during the Byzantine and Ottoman rules have recently entered into a new phase directed towards reconsidering established sources and initiating discussions on new archival materials, there are many aspects of its cross-cultural and religious history that are yet to be fully addressed. First, the Byzantine phase has received substantial attention from scholars until now compared to the period when the patriarchate functioned under the Ottoman rule, which clearly reflects in the available bibliography. Secondly, new facets of the institutional relations between the Patriarchate and the governing institutions of the Byzantine State and the Ottoman Porte, respectively, require further investigations by turning towards already consecrated sources or exploring new archival materials. This can also apply to the diplomatic and ecclesiastical relations of the Patriarchate with other Christian institutions and religious groups (i.e., Catholics, Protestants, and Eastern Christians of various traditions) that in turn can offer exciting episodes of historical and cultural entanglements in time and space. The Ottoman archives are not yet fully explored, and sources in Greek, Arabic, Slavonic, or other languages of Eastern Christianity, stored in repositories throughout the Christian East, are still awaiting their editors. In order to grasp the complete picture of the Patriarchate&rsquo;s political and ecclesiastical affairs alongside its cultural contributions to the life of Eastern Christian communities, the academic discussions have to turn also towards a wide array of literary sources in manuscript or printed editions, such as theological treatises, hagiography, chronicles or letters, and not only to the official chancellery documents.<br />\r\nA comprehensive analysis of the vast network of monasteries (<em>stauropegias</em>) under the jurisdiction of the patriarchate is a matter of paramount importance for understanding its political influence and financial history during late Byzantium and early modern times. In their turn, these s<em>tauropegias</em> had their own <em>metochia</em> (monasteries and <em>sketes </em>dependent on them), which makes the history of the ecclesiastical network even more complex and fascinating. All these institutions assured the Patriarchate annual revenues, in money or livestock. Along with the Ottoman conquests during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the Orthodox Greek patriarchs turned their attention towards the Balkan areas for their network of <em>stauropegias</em> and, starting with the sixteenth century onwards, this network expanded to Wallachia and Moldavia. Mapping out these networks will enhance our understanding of the ecclesiastical power relations of the Patriarchate of Constantinople on a more global scale, which involves the Eastern Patriarchates, Mount Athos and Sinai. It will also contribute to a better picture of the movement of people, finances and goods in various historical, social and cultural contexts.<br />\r\nThe historiography on the Patriarchate still lacks detailed studies and monographs on the patriarchs. If the Byzantine phase benefited of more attention in this regard, for the period of the Ottoman rule only few such analysis exist. Good examples are the two monographs, first on Patriarch Gennadios II Scholarios and second on Patriarch Kyrillos Loukaris, respectively, are the exception. However, the achievements and activities of patriarchs should not constitute the only focus of scholars to understand the Patriarchate&rsquo;s intricate history, but they should turn their attention to other prelates or people affiliated with the institution that shaped its existence along the centuries. For instance, the Neo-Aristotelian philosopher and director of the Patriarchal Academy, Theophilos Korydallefs has always been an enigmatic and intriguing figure for scholars, and the renowned official of the patriarchate and famous Phanariot bibliophile Nikolaos Karatzas has been a prominent figure of the patriarchal chancellery, and recently attracted much scholarly attention for his erudite activities. Lastly, detailed investigations based on new archival material concerning the inter-institutional relations between the Eastern Patriarchates is a desideratum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nThe bibliography on the Patriarchate of Constantinople during the Byzantine period and early modern times is quite extensive.

    "text":"<p><em>By&nbsp;Ekaterina Solodovnikova</em> | <em>State Institute for Art studies (PhD student)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nA three fold icon of the True Cross (<em>stauroteca</em>) (10.7 x 7.5 x 1.5 cm) carved in walnut and set in a gold frame originates from the treasury of the Holy-Trinity Lavra (monastery) which is located 70 km far from Moscow. The inscription in Russian wraps around the edges of the gold frame and reveals that the object was commissioned by the Abbot of the Lavra, Vassian Rylo, during the reign of grand prince Vasiliy II (1415 - 1462), and executed by monk Ambrose in 1456. He was a famous wood-carver in the second half of the 15th century.<br />\r\nInside the object, the center panel has a recess intended for the cross, perhaps a relic of the True Cross (which is lost); on both sides of it the figures of the Virgin Mary and John the Theologian are represented as in a typical Crucifixion scene. They are depicted on a ground that carries a gothic-style ornament with circular motifs. Above the cross there are two mourning angels and the inscription &quot;\u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044b&quot; (&quot;King of Glory&quot;).<br />\r\nOn the side panels there are images of the church feasts (which are preserved only on the left part): Candlemas, Baptism, Crucifixion, Descent into hell, the Pentecost, the Assumption of the Virgin. These compositions are made in a technique of open-work carving and set against a background of gold. Slavonic inscriptions run above the Church feast scenes and under the horizontal arm of the cross &ldquo;\u0416\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0449\u0438 \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442 \u0422\u0432\u043e\u0435\u044f \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b (\u0435\u0441\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043c)...&rdquo; (&ldquo;The life-giving Cross of Your goodness which You bestowed to us&rdquo;). The golden frame is topped with a small image of Christ &ldquo;Not-made-by-human-hands&rdquo;. The exterior of the object is decorated with a beautiful filigree lace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe triptych, in this case, refers to &ldquo;small format&rdquo; artifacts (like breast icons, portable icon-folders, and portable iconostasis, panagias), which were objects for private devotion. Often they served as reliquaries as well. The triptych has a high importance for the stylistic conception of Russian art of its &ldquo;Gold era&rdquo;, which in Moscow school starts with Andrey Roubliov (early 15th century) and ends with Dionisius (end of 15th century). The most difficult problem for studying Muscovite art production of the 15th century is that few objects survive. One of them is the triptych of Ambrose, which was repeatedly the focus in scholarship. Among its researchers were Yury Olsufiev, Ivan Nekrasov, Viktor Lazarev, Gennadiy Popov. In their works these scholars used a very important method of analysis, which included a stylistic comparison of painting and embroidery with sculptural artifacts. The latter often have secure dates and help with chronology.<br />\r\nDespite the outstanding artistic quality and distinguished provenance of the three-fold icon, scholars considered its style to be old-fashioned for the 15th century. They found it more similar to the artistic style of the 14th century (works of Theophanes the Greek) because of the plastic sculptural shape of the figures, their heavy proportions, as well as impulsive and individualized movement. These views in Soviet scholarship were based on a very popular idea that Russian art separated from Byzantine art and began to develop independently at the beginning of the 15th century. According to this conception, the main achievement of Muscovite art, which it acquired thanks to Andrey Roubliov, is a rhythmical harmony of lines, in which sculptural shape is not so accentuated, the movement is less active than in Palaiologan art, and emotional expressiveness is replaced by contemplation. These peculiarities were believed to have remained stable throughout the 15th century from Roubliov to Dionisius.<br />\r\nDisagreeing with these ideas, we can notice the sculptural qualities of the triptych play a more important role than in the 14th c. art. There is much less space in the composition and the figures do not plunge into the background (as we can see in Palaiologan wood carving and painting), but seem to be in front of the composition. The figures are separated from one another - images of the Mother of God and John the Theologian are carved in &ldquo;box-shaped&rdquo; plates, which exclude the existence of a common space, one of the main characteristics of the late-Palaiologan art. This is also indicated by the absence of a free and equable composition. The figures form a rigid structure, grouping at the edges of the Christological scenes. The compositions are densely filled, active movement stops, and the postures are tense. Due to the recent ideas (Ostashenko) all these features perfectly characterize stylistic development of the middle of the 15th century when Russian and Byzantine artists searched for inspiration in Gothic traditions. Although analogies to this style do not exist among Muscoviet icons (they have not survived) we can find them in the monuments that derive from other centers of Russian art and date to the middle of the 15th century.<br />\r\nEmbroidered images on textiles created between 1441 and 1444 in Novgorod demonstrate a weightiness combined with an underlined silhouette; similar to the decoration of the triptych. The static and tensely restrained figures are shown in strong reversals to the foreground, and the background is perceived as a solid wall not a free open space as evident in Late Palaiologan time. The number of analogies could be expanded with the monuments of Novgorod, Tver and Pskov (like the icon &ldquo;Three hierarchs and Paraskeva&rdquo;, 1440s, Tretyakov Gallery). But it is important that the same features are inherent to Byzantine monuments. This is evidenced in the icon of Angelos Akotantos - &ldquo;Christ on the Throne&rdquo; from Zakynthos museum dated to the middle of the 15th century. The composition gives the impression of a solid and an immovable structure, gestures are fixed, contours are rigid.<br />\r\nSimilarity between the triptych and Greek and Russian icons from Pskov, Novgorod prove that its carved images characterize general stylistic tendencies in the art of the 15th century. The idea that its style was old-fashioned appeared due to a wrong conception of development of Muscovite art in the 15th century. The need to abandon it has been increasingly expressed by Russian scholars in recent years (esp. Elena Ostashenko, Lev Lifshits). They consider that Russian art continued to develop the same way as Byzantine art and the ideas conveyed by Roubliov could not be current during the 15th century. According to these new ideas, the characteristic of the second quarter of the 15th century is the strong impact of Western traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nNikolayeva T.V. <em>Plastic Art of Old Russia.

The end of the inscription is marked with a symbol.<br />\r\nTranslation: This cymbal was made by the humble Archbishop Anastasius Krimkovin, Metropolitan of Suceava, and was given to the Monastery of Dochiariou on the Holy Mountain Athos, where there is a church of the chief commanders Michael and Gabriel in the year 7122, month of July, 21.<br />\r\nAnastasie Crimca, metropolitan of Suceava (1608&ndash;17/1619&ndash;29), was an author and illuminator. He copied several manuscripts, some of which include portraits. Among the individuals that he depicted are his parents, Constantin Movil\u0103 or himself. In 1609, he founded Dragomirna Monastery (modern Romania), where he was later buried. The bell is dated following the Byzantine calendar, that is, since the creation of the world. The inscription refers to the instrument as a cymbal, the term used in other inscriptions on Moldavian bells dated to the 16th and 17th centuries. A bell casting workshop discovered in Suceava suggests that perhaps this example, too, was produced in the former capital of Moldavia. Although the inscription informs us that Crimca made the bell, what is meant is that he ordered it and paid for it. The bell was cast in July 1614 and so it must have arrived at Dochiariou at some point after this date.<br />\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe bell is not included in modern scholarship devoted to bells cast in the north-Danubian principalities and so it constitutes a new sample of bell casting manufacture in Moldavia in this period. It shares features with other Moldavian bells; for example, the inscription occupies the main body of the object. This detail makes bells rather distinctive, since such metal instruments normally show the inscription in the shape of an encircling band around the bottom and/or the top. Also, the name of the bell founder (master) is not mentioned. Indeed, Moldavian bells remained anonymous until the 18th century. Their inscriptions usually name only the donor. The earlier reported bells cast in Moldavia are dated to the second half of the 15th century; they were donated by Stephan III (r. 1457&ndash;1504). Nevertheless, bell ringing was surely employed before. Currently, the oldest bell in the Romanian principalities dates to 1385 and is found in Cotmeana Monastery (established by Radu I [r. 1377&ndash;1383]), in Wallachia. Therefore, church bells were employed in the Danubian principalities since at least the 14th century, and probably earlier.<br />\r\nAnastasie Crimca ordered the bell as a gift to Dochiariou Monastery on Mount Athos. The patronage of Moldavia and Wallachia toward Mount Athos is well known; for example, the construction and decoration of the<em> katholikon </em>of Dochiariou was financed by the Moldavian leader Alexander IV L\u0103pu\u0219neanu (r. 1552&ndash;61/1564&ndash;68). To date, however, bells had not been listed among the objects donated to Athonite monasteries. It is unknown whether in this early period other Romanian bells were sent to Mount Athos or if Crimca&rsquo;s was a unique instance. Moreover, the bell demonstrates that Romanian donors were not reduced to the rulers and their families. Individuals from the higher clergy, like the metropolitan of Suceava, also made donations to Mount Athos, especially from the 16th century onward. Hence, the bell at Dochiariou Monastery sheds further light on the relations between Moldavia and the Athonite community during the long period of Ottoman rule.<br />\r\nBell ringing was strictly forbidden in territories ruled directly by the Ottoman Empire until the mid-19th century. As a result, any bell casting manufacture that existed before the Ottoman conquest vanished. Because of their privileged status, Athonite monasteries were permitted to use bell ringing during most of the Ottoman period. At the moment the bell of Anastasie Crimca is the oldest reported bell on Mount Athos. It allowed the monks of Dochiariou to regulate their everyday life and religious calendar. To do so, the Athonite community employed both <em>semantra</em> and bells. The <em>semantron </em>was the traditional instrument of the Byzantine Church; it usually was an elongated piece of wood that was hit with a mallet to call the faithful to worship. Since the production of bells was not available near Mount Athos, monks had to import the objects from far away. For this reason, the gift of Archbishop Anastasie was special.<br />\r\nIt is worth noting that during the 17th and 18th centuries Athonite monasteries mainly relied on Venetian founders to obtain bells. Both Wallachia and Moldavia were vassal states of the Ottoman sultan at that time. Their political status allowed them, together with the Republic of Ragusa, to ring church bells freely. As a consequence, bell casting continued in these regions. We can only wonder whether the bell of Anastasie Crimca was requested by the monastic community of Docheiariou or the metropolitan was aware that bells were scarce in the Ottoman Empire and so the monks would appreciate his special gift.<br />\r\nNo comprehensive study on the bells of Mount Athos has been undertaken yet, but so far the bell of Anastasie Crimca is the only Moldavian bell on the Holy Mountain to have been identified and studied. Other Romanian bells reached Mount Athos; they date to the second half of the 19th century and after, but they likely follow in a longer tradition of such gifts and commissions. For instance, a bell cast in Bucharest in 1861 was ordered by a monk from Iviron Monastery. It is worth noting that around this time bell casting was introduced on Mount Athos. In 1883, Athelstan Riley visited the Holy Mountain and saw bell founders based in Karyes. They cast several bells found in Athonite monasteries. Particularly significant is the work of Ioannis Nikolaou, whose earlier reported bell on Mount Athos was cast in 1862.<br />\r\nNonetheless, bells also continued to be imported from abroad, particularly from Russia. In the early 20th century, the skete of Saint John the Forerunner, one of the two Romanian foundations on the Holy Mountain, received bells donated by Romanians. For example, a bell cast in Bucharest in 1911 was given by Canuta Ionescu, the mayor of Urla\u021bi, a town located to the north of the Romanian capital. Even in 2017, the skete obtained bells cast in V&acirc;lcea County, in the central-south area of Romania.<br />\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\n<p>Chiaburu, Elena. &ldquo;Despre clopotele \u0219i clopotarii din \u021aara Moldovei (p&acirc;n\u0103 la 1859).&rdquo; <em>Tyragetia </em>9, no. 2 (2015): 29&ndash;50.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">A more recent study focusing on the bells of Moldavia, also covering the long chronology between the Middle Ages and the mid-19th century.

    "text":"<p><em>By Elisa Emaldi, Paola Novara | Museo Nazionale di Ravenna (Ministero della Cultura)</em><br />\r\n<p><strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe early Renaissance terracotta decorations that adorn the buildings of the city of Emilia-Romagna are a characteristic element of the region. The large availability of clay that the territory offers has led to the widespread use of brick, both in construction and for decorative purposes. But in Ravenna, a few centuries earlier, the terracotta decoration had a very particular nuance of use. The National Museum of Ravenna possesses among its early medieval archaeological sculptures an interesting corpus of approximately twenty reliefs carved in terracotta tiles dated between the 10th and the 14th century. Those sculptures, used as facade decoration both in religious architecture and later in civil buildings, have plant and animal motifs and are typical of the Adriatic region. The oldest elements of the museum&rsquo;s lapidary belong to two religious buildings located near Ravenna, the monastery of Sant&rsquo;Adalberto in Pereo, early 11th century, and the hostel for pilgrims (<em>xenodochium</em>) of San Pietro in Vincoli, middle of the 11th century. For both destroyed buildings, the existing comparison is the 11th century decoration of Santa Maria di Pomposa in the ancient diocese of Ravenna (50 km north), which has preserved the decoration in its original layout. The terracotta friezes still decorate the fa&ccedil;ade of the vestibule, with bands extending along its entire length, with arched lintels on the columns of the entrance and surrounding as a circular frame two lateral stone paterae. The linearity of the median frieze is interrupted by two terracotta crosses and enriched by tiles with fantastic animals.<br />\r\nThe same types of terracotta attested in Ravenna are present throughout the upper Adriatic basin, starting from Romagna (with some examples also in Rimini as well as in Ravenna) then, through Venice and Torcello, up to Dalmatia and Croatia, from Cres to Zader. In Dalmatia, a well-studied case is the original facade of the abbey church of St. Mary in Zadar, which was consecrated in 1091. The terracotta fragments found in the archaeological excavations of the abbey church (now in the Archaeological Museum in Zadar), decorated with plant motifs similar to the Italian ones, bring on their back Roman ordinal numbers. These marks, never found on Italian tiles, perhaps served as an indication to ensure that the terracotta tiles would be placed in the right order on the wall. These are precious indicia that the terracottas were produced in the Venice-Ravenna area and then brought to the opposite Adriatic shore.<br />\r\nIn all the above-mentioned cases, the decorative elements have the same characteristics: modular blocks, used to form ribbon-like bands and crosses, are decorated with two wicker branches in opposing spirals and include leaves or bunches of grapes, animated mainly by birds and quadrupeds. Next to these, rectangular or cuspidate tiles contain single images of fantastic hybrid animals: often is the dog-lion and a variant of the simurgh, the winged dragon-peacock of the Sassanid tradition.<br />\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe iconographic models of the terracotta tiles can be traced in the ornamental themes and repertoire of the sumptuary art widespread in the Near East, whose transmission in the West probably occurred through the diffusion of fabrics produced especially in Syria and in the Constantinopolitan area. The decorative repertoire, drawn from the Sassanian tradition, became popular both in the art of Byzantium and Western Europe and also in Islamic art from the 7th century onward. Using tiles arranged in series to form endless decorations, which embrace the entire width of the wall without any connection with the structure of the building, constituted also a real innovation, a foreign taste acquired in the West and mediated through Byzantine works of art, an appropriate decoration for religious and secular purposes.<br />\r\nSimilar decorations were once in the basilica of San Marco in Venice, and their role is still much discussed; these bricks were recovered between 1860 and 1877 down the church&rsquo;s walls and are currently exhibited in the cloister of St. Apollonia. Very similar to the Ravenna and Pomposa examples, they have been variously attributed to the &ldquo;second&rdquo; or to the &ldquo;third&rdquo; phase of construction of the church of San Marco, that means to the reconstruction of the building commissioned by Doge Pietro Orseolo after the fire of 976 or to the reconstruction promoted by Doge Contarini, undertaken in 1063 and completed in 1091. This doubt leaves open the hypothesis that the Venetian Basilica has absolute precedence for this decorative form over the remaining production documented or discovered in the upper Adriatic basin. This could also support the transmigration of the trend: terracotta tiles were imported from the Venice-Ravenna area to the Croatian coast, economically and culturally linked with Ravenna during the Exarchate dominion, and then to Venice. The Adriatic has long been a bridge rather than a rift, with different cultures and languages mirroring each other. The koine on both sides of the Adriatic may also have been strengthened by the bond between eminent abbots and Benedictine monks who shared a common religious, artistic and ideological background.<br />\r\nWhereas same motifs, such the grapes and vines are partly of Greek-Roman origin and were also used in Ravenna in Late Antique art, the Orientalizing character of the tiles&rsquo; decorations is evident: the whole repertoire goes beyond the decorations of printed terracotta present in northern Italy in the first centuries of the Roman Empire, introducing populated spirals and animals symmetrically approached to the Tree of Life, fighting animals, griffins and other fantastic animals, as well as some marginal iconographic connotations, such as, for example, generally marking birds and fantastic animals with the fluttering <em>pativ</em>, a symbol of royalty in the Sassanid culture peculiar to the iconography of the Near East. We can assume that it is the contact with the Byzantine world that has maintained some motifs, figures and animals in circulation, in some cases from their Sassanid origin down to their Romanesque outcome.<br />\r\nAs for the &ldquo;Iranian Glory&rdquo;, the <em>senmurv</em> or <em>simurgh</em>, the winged creature with a composite nature and gifts, and with similar fabulous creatures composed of parts of diverse animals to underline different symbols, or the sacred plant icons related to life, eternality and cure, it is impossible to define to what extent the original meaning had kept intact its symbolic value in time and space. Other than indicating the Way to the faithful, the building decoration could have had a deeper meaning, echoed within a global culture. Positive, apotropaic, energetic symbols enveloped the building while the silk robes, embroidered with similar motifs, dressed the kings or wrapped the saints&rsquo; remains. The decorated tiles exalted a declaration of faith, show wealth, respond to a desire for beauty, protect and shield users.<br />\r\nLittle by little, however, the decorative vocabulary of the East was forgotten and in many parts of Italy another type of terracotta decoration embellished the external walls of churches and palaces with a new strong style, and reflecting the taste of the period: at the end of the Middle Ages, new masters, such as Pollaiolo and Mantegna, revived classical motifs through drawings after the Antique, copied and reproduced in admirable friezes.<br />\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nNovara, Paola.<em> S.

    "text":"<p><em>By Roksolana Kosiv | Lviv National Academy of Arts, Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv, Ukraine </em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nThe icon known as the &ldquo;Protection of the Theotokos with Sts. Anthony and Theodosius of Pechersk&rdquo; was purchased for the National Museum in Lviv in 1931 from the Archangel Michael church in Cheremoshnia (now Lviv region, Ukraine). The Theotokos holds a red veil over the people, which is a symbol of her protection. This is the feast (celebrated on the 1 of October) and iconography which was not known in the Byzantine tradition. The scene appeared approximately in the late 12th century in the Kyivan Rus.<br />\r\nThe Cheremoshnia icon was painted paired with an icon of the Entry of the Virgin Mary into the Temple and St. John the Theologian and St. Demetrios (both icons are stored in the Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv NML i-1870, i-1871). The icons are painted on linden boards with tempera and oil, which was commonly used by Lviv masters in the early 17th century. Although name of the author of the icons from Cheremoshnia is not known, the manner of the painting and the composition of the icons indicate the impact of leading artists of the so-called Lviv School of the first half of the 17th century &ndash; in particular Fedir Senkovych and Mykola Petrakhnovych. The Protection icon is quite large (106 x 144.5 cm), but it is not known where exactly it was located in the church.<br />\r\nThe scene of the Protection of the Theotokos is two-tiered. In the center of the upper portion stands the Virgin Mary facing Christ. A prayer written on the scroll she holds is directed toward Christ. The apostles stand to the left of the Virgin Mary, and St. John the Baptist, hierarchs, and a deacon to the right. The figures have no inscriptions but can be identified by their iconography. Angels are depicted above the group in the top tier of the composition. In the lower tier, St. Roman the Melodist is shown with St. Andrew the Fool for Christ and his disciple Epiphany and a group of men to his right. To his left are two archbishops, followed by a group of monks and two rulers before a group of soldiers. The Virgin Mary is depicted against the three-domed church with a coffered vault and arched windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nThe Protection of the Theotokos icon from Cheremoshnia stands out among similar works with details of the central scene and depictions of Sts. Anthony and Theodosios of Pechersk facing the central composition. The Mother of God addresses Christ on the left, and the text in Church Slavonic of the Ruthenian recension of her prayer, written on a white scroll, changes its direction &ndash; from right to left. However, unlike early Greek writing or boustrophedon, almost all letters remain facing right. The text is taken from the Life of St. Andrew the Fool for Christ, where the Mother of God prays for the faithful and the city: &ldquo;\u0446\u0440\u0443 \u043d[\u0431\u043d\u0438] [\u043f\u0440\u0438]\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u0430\u0433\u043e \u0447\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u0449\u0433\u043e \u0442\u044f / \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438[\u0437\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e]\u0449\u0430[\u0433\u043e] \u0438\u043c\u044f \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0454 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0454 \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u043e \u043c\u0463\u0441\u0442\u043e / \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0435 \u0431[&hellip;] \u043f[\u0430\u043c\u044f] \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0454\u0433\u043e &omega;\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0463\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e / \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438 [&hellip;] (&ldquo;<em>Heavenly King, receive every man who glorifies you and calls upon your holy name, and every city where there is a memory of my name, sanctify this city and glorify it</em> [&hellip;]&rdquo; (reconstructed and shortened). The text is similar to what can be found in the 16th century manuscript Prologues and in the 1619 Anthologion of Kyiv-Pechersk press on the feast day of the Protection.<br />\r\nOn the Cheremoshnia icon, the large figures of Sts. Anthony and Theodosius of Pechersk become like participants in the Protection scene. In the contemporary environment of Kyiv and the Ukrainian lands in general, St. Anthony &ndash; the founder of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra &ndash; and St. Theodosios &ndash; the abbot and builder of the Dormition church of the Lavra &ndash; were particularly celebrated by leading theologians, including Metropolitan Peter Mohyla. Images of both saints often appear in miniatures of the 17th century liturgical books of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra press. In the second half of the 17th century, their images were also popular in icon painting. The Cheremoshnia icon is exemplary in this case because it is one of the oldest preserved icons from the Lviv region with the depiction of these two saints. It connects them with the scene of the Protection of the Theotokos, which at that time became significant for society and patron of the Cossack army &ndash; most of the Cossack Sich churches were consecrated to the Protection of the Mother of God.<br />\r\nAnother icon of the Protection of the Theotokos, painted around the same time in the 1640s, has a similar iconography. This icon is also associated with the Lviv School (NML i-1014; provenance unknown). As evidenced by the painting manner, this icon was created by one of the artists of the iconostasis of the Sts. Paraskevi church in Lviv. The mentioned iconostasis is the prominent example of the Lviv School and the only preserved in original version <em>in situ</em>. It has the same text on the scroll of the Theotokos, where she prays for the city &ndash; apparently for Lviv &ndash; written from left to right. This text appears on the icons of the Protection only in these two examples, which may indicate a connected provenance. Both icons attest to the spread of a common iconographic model of the Protection of the Theotokos among Lviv artists, which can be traced back to an earlier prototype, where the Mother of God is interceding to Christ. Today, icons of the Protection of the Theotokos painted by Lviv masters before the 17th century are unknown, although icons with this iconography have survived since the end of the 13th century (they all differ in the details of the composition). On the second-mentioned icon, there are also two hierarchs depicted, one young in a mitre without a halo, and the other older with a halo above which the inscription &ldquo;Patriarch Tarasii&rdquo; is found. This is the depiction of St. Tarasios, Patriarch of Constantinople (784&ndash;806), although he was not a contemporary of either Andrew the Fool or Roman the Melodist.<br />\r\nThe image of the young hierarch in both icons resembles a portrait of Peter Mohyla (1596&ndash;1647), who came from a Moldavian family, studied at the Brotherhood school at the Dormition Church in Lviv, and, in April 1633, was consecrated as the Metropolitan of Kyiv, Halych, and All Rus in the same church at the age of 37. His depiction next to the Constantinople Patriarch Tarasios may emphasize that the contemporary Kyiv Metropolitans were exarchs of the Constantinople Patriarch. It is also worth noting the importance of the Dormition Church in Lviv and its Stavropegial brotherhood, which was the center of Ukrainian life in the city and region. It is likely that the newly built Dormition Church in Lviv (1591&ndash;1629), with its Renaissance features, including a coffered vault, is depicted on the icon of the Protection of the Theotokos from Cheremoshnia. This would indicate that the icon was painted with the thought of this site, while its iconography conveyed the protection of the Theotokos and the guidance of the early founders &ndash; Sts. Anthony and Theodosius &ndash; of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nAleksandrovych, Volodymyr. <em>\u041f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0456. \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044c\u043e\u0432\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0456\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0456\u044f. \u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432: \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0456\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 \u0430\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0456\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438</em>, 2010.

    "text":"<p><em>By Roksolana Kosiv | Lviv National Academy of Arts, Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv, Ukraine</em></p><p><strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nThe epitaphios from the church of the Archangel Michael in the village of Zhyrivka near Lviv is the only 15th-century Ruthenian work of this type and one of few surviving examples of medieval church embroidery in this region of Eastern Europe. The epitaphios (from Greek \u1f18&pi;&iota;&tau;\u03ac&phi;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf; &ndash; &ldquo;above the tomb&rdquo;) is a cloth with an image of the body of Christ. It is used in Lenten services two days before Easter, symbolizing the burial of Christ. The 15th-century Zhyrivka epitaphios entered the collection of the National Museum in Lviv in 1913 in exchange for a new epitaphios that was bought to the church. Since 1913, when the museum opened to the public, and until the beginning of Russia&rsquo;s full-scale aggression against Ukraine in 2022, the Zhyrivka epitaphios was on permanent display for all to see, study, and appreciate.<br />\r\nThe Zhyrivka epitaphios depicts a seven-figure scene of the Lamentation of Christ, including Theotokos, St. John the Theologian and four Archangels. The scene is symmetrical; the Virgin Mary sits on the left and St. John stands on the right of the reclining figure of Christ. Two angels stand behind the body of Christ to either side. The object was embroidered with colored silk, as well as gold and silver metal threads on a plain purple silk. On the back lining, there is a Latin inscription indicating that the epitaphios was renewed in April 1775, apparently transferred to another support &ndash; a patterned raspberry damask, which we see today. Presumably, the inscription &ldquo;\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0457\u0454 \u0432\u044a \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0431\u044a \u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0456\u0441 \u0445\u0430&rdquo; (entombment of our Lord Jesus Christ) on the front was also embroidered at that time. Only the Lamentation scene and the ciborium with a hanging lamp remained from the original embroidery. Probably, after that &ldquo;renovation&rdquo;, the epitaphios diminished in size; there are missing parts of the embroidery along the bottom which indicates that the edges of the original silk were damaged. There is no inscription of a troparion or a liturgical prayer on this embroidery, which is typical for most Byzantine epitaphioi. After the restoration in 2011&ndash;2013, the Zhyrivka epitaphios measured 61.5 x 111.8 cm (the 18th-century damask was transferred to a new plain silk base, thus the epitaphios became bigger).<br />\r\nThe Zhyrivka epitaphios drew the attention of researchers as early as the end of the 19th century. It was exhibited at the Archaeological-Bibliographical Exhibition of the Stauropegion Institute in Lviv in 1888, and the following year it was first published in an album of the exhibition edited by Izydor Sharanevych. As a key object of Ukrainian church art, it has been published repeatedly since the late 19th century. In 1934, the epitaphios was presented at a retrospective exhibition of Ukrainian art in Warsaw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe Zhyrivka epitaphios represents an abbreviated version of the Lamentation of Christ scene where only the Theotokos and St. John the Theologian are depicted as historical characters. In this example, the emphasis is on the symbolic liturgical significance of the iconography. The Virgin Mary holds the head of her Son on her lap and presses her cheek against His, which is an expression of deep spiritual grief and finds parallels with the iconography of Virgin Eleusa, where the Christ Child presses his cheek against the cheek of his mother. The Eucharistic meaning of the scene is emphasized by the angels with rhipidia (liturgical fans), which recall deacons during the consecration of gifts at the Liturgy. The body of Christ lies on the stone of anointing, like on an altar table. The ciborium with a lamp signifies the ciborium above an altar and the &ldquo;eternal&rdquo; lamp that is lit when the consecrated gifts are kept on the altar.<br />\r\nSimilar abbreviated iconographies of the Lamentation scene are known on several late 14th&ndash;15th century epitaphioi from Eastern European cultural centers. These include the <a href=\"https://mappingeasterneurope.princeton.edu/item/the-epitaphios-of-cozia-monastery.html\"><strong>Cozia epitaphios of 1396</strong></a>, the Byzantine epitaphios of Metropolitan Photios (1408&ndash;31) (State Historical Museum, Moscow), the Russian &ldquo;Puchezhska&rdquo; from 1441 (Moscow Kremlin Museums), and the 15th century &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; epitaphioi (Sergiev-Posad Museum). Like the Zhyrivka epitaphios, these works depict the hands of the Savior one next to the other below his chest (except Cozia epitaphios). The epitaphios of Metropolitan Photios has a similar dark red silk background and the same size of the central scene. This testify that these epitaphioi were made after some common pattern or patterns, presumably of Byzantine origin. However, the differences in the proportion of figures, colors and the embroidery techniques means that they belonged to different workshops.<br />\r\nOn the Zhyrivka epitaphios, the gesture of the right hand of Christ resembles a blessing. This can be related to the liturgical prayer, which mentions that Christ offered himself as a sacrifice and blesses this sacrifice as a high priest. By the end of the 15th century, the scene of the Lamentation on epitaphioi acquired a more historical characters, often with dramatic expression. In the 16th century, multi-figure scenes of the Lamentation with women myrrhbearers, Joseph of Arimathea, and Nicodemus become widespread in the Eastern Christian context. Thus, the iconography indicates that the Zhyrivka epitaphios should be dated to the 15th century.<br />\r\nThe Zhyrivka epitaphios find analogies in the icon painting from the Lviv and Peremyshl dioceses of the Ukrainian (then Ruthenian) Church. It is related to several 15th century icons, where certain disproportion in the figures (shorter lower parts), similar drawing techniques, and warm vibrant colors also occur. Like on the icons of that time, there are few golden and silver planes on the epitaphios. This indicates that the embroidery and icon painting workshops shared models and techniques at that time.<br />\r\nThe embroidery of the epitaphios shows a complex technique called &ldquo;by counting the stitches&rdquo; and &ldquo;following the shape&rdquo; with silk, gold, and silver metal threads. The golden and silver threads are attached with silk in the same hue. According to the results of chemical analyses conducted by Myroslava Drul, flat silver wire was used for the silver metal thread, which is wound around the silk thread in the same hue. For the golden thread, gilded silver wire was used.<br />\r\nWe assume that originally the Zhyrivka epitaphios could have belonged to a church in Lviv. In the 15th century, the use of epitaphioi in Ukrainian churches was likely not widespread, so its initial ownership by an ordinary parish church is questionable. The Zhyrivka epitaphios poses a question about the possible role of Metropolitan Photios (a Greek by origin, consecrated as Metropolitan of Kyiv and All Rus&rsquo; in 1408) who visited Halych and Lviv twice, in spreading the use of this type of epitaphioi in the churches of his metropolitanate. Probably, the epitaphios initially belonged to the group of &ldquo;great veils&rdquo;, which had liturgical functions. As far as can be traced, the ritual use of the epitaphioi in Ukrainian churches becomes widespread in the 17th century. This is indicated by records in liturgical books, occasional written testimonies, and preserved works (most of the extant 17th-century epitaphioi are painted in tempera on canvas).<br />\r\nThe Zhyrivka epitaphios attests to the development of medieval church embroidery in the regions of modern Ukraine, which on the one hand was related to icon painting of that time, and on the other hand, represents the spread of a common artistic and liturgical tradition that was adopted from Byzantium and transformed in a local context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong></p><p>Sharanevych, Izydor. <em>\u041e\u0442\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0437 \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u0431\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442\u0435 \u0438 \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0444\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0436\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0438</em>. \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432, 1889. \u0422\u0430\u0431\u043b.

    "text":"<p><em>By Roksolana Kosiv | Lviv National Academy of Arts, Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv, Ukraine</em><br />\r\n<strong>Overview </strong><br />\r\nThe National Museum in Lviv was founded in 1905 by Andrei Sheptytskyi (1900&ndash;44), Metropolitan of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. The museum was originally named &ldquo;The Church Museum&rdquo; as it was planned to collect only works of religious art. Later, the scope of the collection was expanded to secular works of art, but the emphasis was still on works of Ukrainian art, which make up the majority of the collection. In 1911, the museum was renamed to &ldquo;The National Museum in Lviv&rdquo;. During the period of Soviet occupation, the museum&rsquo;s name was changed again to the &ldquo;Lviv State Museum of Ukrainian Art&rdquo;. In 1990, the museum was returned to its historical name, the National Museum in Lviv, and since 2005, it has been named the Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv.<br />\r\nThis institution has the largest collection of Ukrainian church art of the 15th &ndash; 18th centuries. It is famous for the collection of icons, liturgical manuscripts and printed books of the printing houses in Lviv, Kyiv, Univ, Pochaiv. It has a collection of church textiles, ecclesiastical metal objects, decorative wooden works of art and sculpture. The collection began to form from the early years of the museum&rsquo;s activity. Metropolitan Andrei Sheptytskyi took care of the museum and was its main patron until his death. As records of the museum&rsquo;s director, Ilarion Sventsitskyi (who headed the museum from 1905 to 1952) attest, &ldquo;larger and smaller purchases of works were coordinated with the Metropolitan, who had the final say in the expediency of acquiring artifacts&rdquo;. At the call of Metropolitan Sheptytskyi, many priests donated old church items from their churches to the museum. Some works were gifted to the museum during the first decade of its operation.<br />\r\nFor example, in 1909, a rather large group of church textiles, including embroidered vestments of the clergy and liturgical veils of the 17th &ndash; 18th century, were donated by Fr. Danylo Bodrevych from Porokhnyk (now a village in Poland). In 1912, Fr. Stepan Yuryk from St. Nicholas Church in Zolochiv, near Lviv, donated a phelonion (the upper liturgical vestment of a priest) with embroidered figures of the De&euml;sis from the 15th century, which is a rare example of medieval church embroidery of local origin. In 1924, Fr. Volodymyr Tolochko donated an a&euml;r-epitaphios with the scene of the Lamentation of Christ from the late 15th &ndash; early 16th century (from where the a&euml;r-epitaphios was taken is not recorded in the museum&rsquo;s inventory book). This a&euml;r-epitaphios is almost identical to the one in the collection of the Cyril-Belozersky Historical and Artistic Museum-Reserve (Russia). Both works were embroidered in memory of an unknown priest Manuil Ambaratopoulos in a Greek or Moldavian workshop. With the support of Metropolitan Sheptytskyi, some church textiles were transferred to the museum from St. George&rsquo;s Cathedral in Lviv in the 1910s. The director, Ilarion Sventsitskyi, conducted regular expeditions to churches, mostly in the Peremyshl and Lviv dioceses of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, from where he brought various objects.<br />\r\nIn 1939 and after World War II, the Soviet authorities liquidated the Museum of Lviv Theological Academy, the Museum of the Stavropegion Institute in Lviv, the Museum of the Shevchenko Scientific Society, and others. Part of the collections of these museums, including church textiles, were transferred to the National Museum. From these collections, the collection of the Stavropegion Institute in Lviv is worth highlighting, as it possessed valuable examples of church textiles with figurative embroidery. A group of church embroidery from the 15th &ndash; 17th centuries of Greek and Moldavian workshops were transferred from there to the National Museum. Some of them may have originally belonged to the collection of the Dormition Church in Lviv (most of the church textiles in the collection of the Museum of the Stavropegion Institute in Lviv unfortunately do not have a recorded place of provenance).<br />\r\nThe church textiles in the National Museum in Lviv museum collection are part of the Old Decorative Fabric collection, which includes over 1,500 items. The main part of the collection consists of church textiles (and their fragments) from the 15th to 20th centuries, including clerical vestments, liturgical veils for the chalice and paten, and ornamental curtains. The collection of church textiles at the Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv is not the largest in Ukraine (the biggest collection has National Preserve &ldquo;Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra&rdquo;), but it is extremely valuable for examples of medieval embroidery. The works of embroidery from the 15th century are noteworthy in the context of studying Ukrainian art, but also for researching post-Byzantine church embroidery and iconography.<br />\r\nIn general, most of the works in this collection are little-known. This is primarily due to the history of the museum, in particular during the Soviet period, when the National Museum in Lviv and its collections of Ukrainian art were seen as a source of nationalism. Any research and publications on church art had no chance of success due to censorship. In 1952, the Soviet authorities confiscated and destroyed over 1,700 objects, including works of art from the museum. The museum&rsquo;s closed nature, due to the fear of losing works, meant that researchers were rarely allowed to access the collections during the Soviet period.<br />\r\nIn recent decades, museum collections have been more thoroughly studied, primarily through cataloging. However, for non-Ukrainian readers, the works of art held in the Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv, especially the collection of church textiles remain relatively unknown. In the last decades, several articles have been devoted to key works in this collection, and some of the most valuable objects have been presented in the commemorative volumes dedicated to the National Museum in Lviv (in 2005 and 2013) for the first time. The book published in 2013 is bilingual, in Ukrainian and English. In 2013, a catalog of the liturgical veils for the chalice and paten with figurative images was published. This is the first book dedicated to the objects from the collection of church textiles at the Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv. Conservation on the most valuable items of the collection is currently underway, and the process of cataloging and studying the works is ongoing.<br />\r\nThe collection of the National Museum in Lviv is essential to the study of the development of church art, the evolution of stylistic and iconography. The collection of church textiles presents significant objects of medieval embroidery that are unique to this region and important in the study of the development of Ukrainian art. Including them in the broader context of researching post-Byzantine textiles allows tracing common patterns and expanding our knowledge about this type of church art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates </strong><br />\r\nThe collection of church textiles at the National Museum in Lviv raises questions about the artistic centers and workshops where the objects were created. It is also important to trace whether the objects were of local origin or imported from neighboring regions or more distant locations. The most valuable items in the collection are church textiles from the 15th to 18th centuries, consisting of around 300 works of art embroidered with gold and silver metal threads and silk. Objects with figural embroidery allow for the study of how the tradition of iconography developed, what images and scenes were popular on particular items of church textiles during a specific period of time.<br />\r\nIn the National Museum in Lviv are some of the oldest surviving Ukrainian embroidered church textiles, including the 15th century <u><a href=\"https://mappingeasterneurope.princeton.edu/item/the-zhyrivka-epitaphios.html\"><strong>Zhyrivka epitaphios</strong></a></u> and 11 single figures of De&euml;sis from the St. Nicholas church in Zolochiv (Lviv region). The figures were later sewn onto a phelonion. Although the De&euml;sis was often embroidered on the backs of phelonia of the local clergy of the 17th and 18th century, these figures are too large for the size of a phelonion. This suggests that originally the De&euml;sis likely came from a large a&euml;r (liturgical veil) or an altar cloth.<br />\r\nIn the embroidery of the figures of the De&euml;sis, similar to the Zhyrivka epitaphios, colored areas dominate over gold and silver. However, the proportions of the figures and the manner of drawing indicate that these works come from different workshops. Both objects have analogues with 15th century icons from the Lviv and Peremyshl regions, in particular, with the De&euml;sis from the iconostases of local churches. The Zolochiv De&euml;sis depicts Christ on the throne in the center, with the Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, the Sts. apostles Peter and Paul, and four holy hierarchs: Basil the Great, John Chrysostom, Gregory the Theologian, and Nicholas, all shown in full height. This type of the De&euml;sis with selected saints in full height is depicted in all surviving Ukrainian icons of this iconography from the 15th century.<br />\r\nAmong the works of church embroidery, we can also distinguish the objects of Greek and Moldavian figurative embroidery, including, in addition to the aforementioned a&euml;r-epitaphios with the scene of the Lamentation of Christ, also an a&euml;r or podea of the 16th century with the image of Christ on the throne and apostles. We assume that some of the embroideries could have been gifts to the Dormition church in Lviv, which in the 16th and 17th century had close contacts with Moldavian voivodes, who were also its benefactors. For example, one of the epitrachelia with full-length images of the bishops has an inscription that it was &ldquo;created by Vasylii, the voivode of the Moldavian land&rdquo; in 1643. This refers to the Moldavian voivode Basil Lupu (r. 1634&ndash;53), the father-in-law of Bohdan Khmelnytsky and the patron of the reconstruction of the Piatnytska Church in Lviv.<br />\r\nThe material evidence also exhibits an adaptation of Eastern and Western visual forms and techniques. This is evident in a 17th-century cape with rich figurative embroidered compositions, which originates from the Lviv Armenian Cathedral. The iconography of this liturgical garment is dedicated to the Lord&rsquo;s Cross and the Savior, and is associated with the dedication of the Armenian Church of the Holy Cross in Lviv (which no longer exists). Based on the stylistic and technical features of the embroidery, the cape has been dated to the second half of the 17th century. The object may have belonged to the Armenian pro-uniate bishop Mykola Torosovych (1627&ndash;81), who sought support from the Roman Archbishop during his long and conflict-ridden rule. In the second half of the 17th century, the Armenian clergy gradually adopted the Latin form of the Liturgy and, accordingly, Latin liturgical vestments. This young Basilian monk was ordained as a bishop in the Armenian Church of the Holy Cross in Lviv with support from the former Catholicos-Patriarch of all Armenians, Melchizedek. The most inscriptions on the cape are in the Old Ukrainian language written in Cyrillic script, and certain compositions, such as Christ as the Good Shepherd, indicate the impact of Catholic iconography. This suggests that the cape may have been embroidered by local, possibly Lviv master (masters) of embroidery. However, so far no embroidered objects have been identified that can be conclusively linked to Lviv embroidery masters or workshops of that time.<br />\r\nThe collection also includes embroidered figurative compositions from the first half of the 17th century, which were obtained from the church in the village of Porokhnyk. The cross-shaped design of the four works suggests that they may have originally belonged to omophorion, the liturgical vestment of a bishop, so it is possible that these embroideries were originally intended for the bishop of the Peremyshl diocese. At that time, the parish in the village of Porokhnyk was part of the Peremyshl diocese. One of the embroideries depicts the Virgin Mary with Sts. Anthony and Theodosios of the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, indicating a connection to Kyivan traditions. It is also possible that it was created in a Kyivan workshop. This iconography was relevant to the faithful of the Peremyshl diocese for the purpose of religious affiliation, which is an issue that became acute in the 17th century when two bishops claimed authority over the diocese: one Uniat (united with the Roman Church), and the other Non-Uniate, subordinate to the Kyiv orthodox Metropolitan.<br />\r\nA group of works from the 17th century belongs to the workshop of the Kyiv convent of the Ascension of the Lord, which was renowned for its church textiles in the 17th&ndash;18th centuries. In particular, the mother of hetman Ivan Mazepa &ndash; Maria Magdalyna, who was the abbess of this nunnery from 1686 to 1707, was involved in church embroidery. Numerous embroidered liturgical veils for the chalice and paten are associated with this workshop. The Lamentation scene was usually embroidered on the a&euml;rs produced in this workshop. The &ldquo;Melismos&rdquo; composition (with the Christ in the chalice) often appeared in the center of the small veil for the chalice, with four archangels on the sides. On the paired veil for the paten, the Mother of God with the Christ Child in front of her chest was embroidered, which reflected the symbolism of liturgical veils. On one of the veils for the chalice, in addition to the liturgical prayer, the name of a nun Anastasia and her two pupils, nuns Alepiada and Anna, appear. These nuns were probably the ones who executed the veil. The workshop of the Kyiv convent of the Ascension of the Lord is also credited with precious liturgical vestments. Some of them are stored at the National Museum in Lviv, but the most of the preserved object belonged to the collection of the National Preserve &ldquo;Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra&rdquo;.<br />\r\nThe collection of church textiles in the Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv reflects the development of textile production and church interiors structured through the use of textiles. Textiles with figurative compositions attest to local tradition of church embroidery and reflect the widespread tendency in the 15th&ndash;17th centuries to use imported works, mostly of Greek or Moldavian workshops. These objects make it possible to trace the connections between different artistic traditions and to identify mutual iconographic types with analogies in other media, such as engravings or icons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nSydor-Oshurkevych, Oleksandra. &ldquo;\u041f\u0430\u043c&rsquo;\u044f\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0430\u043f\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f XV&ndash;XVI \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0442\u044c \u0443 \u0437\u0431\u0456\u0440\u0446\u0456 \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0456\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u044e \u0443 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0456&rdquo;. <em>\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0456\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0456 \u0428\u0435\u0432\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430. \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0456 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0456\u0441\u0456\u0457 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0430 \u0443\u0436\u0438\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0446\u0442\u0432\u0430. \u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432</em> [&ldquo;Objects of Sacred Embroidery of the 15th&ndash;16th centuries in the collection of the National Museum in Lviv&rdquo;. <em>Notes of the Shevchenko Scientific Society.

    "text":"<p><em>By Roksolana Kosiv | Lviv National Academy of Arts, Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv, Ukraine</em><br />\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Zhovkva iconostasis was painted between 1697 and 1699 by Ivan Rutkovych for the church of the Nativity of Christ at Basilian Monastery in Zhovkva (Ukraine). It is considered one of the finest examples of monumental iconostasis in Ukrainian art, measuring 10.85 x 11.87 m. Unique in this region, it consists of seven tiers (usually, iconostases of that period had only five tiers) and has 82 preserved icons, including images on doorposts of the Royal Doors and the Deacon Doors (at least six other icons of the iconostasis are lost). The tiers, from bottom to top, consist of the predella with the ornaments, the sovereign icons, additional tier (with the images that were thematically connected with the sovereign icons), the Sunday-Pentecostal register, the festal icons, the De&euml;sis, and the prophetic images. A large Crucifix with the Passion scenes (the height of the Crucifixion is 3.30 m) stands at the top of the iconostasis.<br />\r\nThe icons of the iconostasis have three execution dates and carry two signatures of the artist. The date 1697 is written on the icon of the Baptism in the sovereign tier, where it is stated that the icon was &ldquo;funded by the pious gentlemen of the shoemakers guild&rdquo;. On the predella below it, there is a date of 1698, the name of the artist Ivan Rutkovych, and a text that repeats information about the donors of the Baptism icon. The date of 1699, presumably the completion date of the work on the iconostasis, and the signature of the artist &ldquo;Ivan Rutkovych, painter of Zhovkva&rdquo; are found on the icon of the Last Supper.<br />\r\nIn the 19th century, the iconostasis was either sold or transferred to the \u0441hurch of the Synaxis of the Theotokos in the village Nova Skvaryava near Zhovkva. From that church, it was transported to the National Museum in Lviv in June 1937 where it has been stored to this day. Four icons from the sovereign tier of the iconostasis and several others have not survived (they were probably lost in the 19th century). The last complete restoration and reconstruction of the iconostasis were carried out by the museum between 2007 and 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe Zhovkva iconostasis by Ivan Rutkovych stands out for its expanded iconographic program, which reflects not only theological innovations but also historical realities. One of the peculiarities of the iconostasis is the additional tier with images thematically related to the sovereign tier icons and the Deacon&rsquo;s Doors with the images of the archangels Michael and Gabriel. The additional tier began to appear in the iconostasis of the Lviv school in the first half of the 17th century. In the Zhovkva iconostasis, it consisted of 10 icons: the Christ in Glory, the Holy Family, the Old Testament Trinity, Christ in the house of Mary and Martha, Christ healing the woman with the hemorrhage, Three Angels walking towards Sodom and Gomorrah, the Flight into Egypt, Christ sending disciples to preach, and the Preaching of St. John the Baptist (the first icon on the left before the Christ in Glory is not preserved).<br />\r\nRutkovych also developed a separate Sunday-Pentecostal tier in his iconostases, which contained scenes of Gospel stories that are read on the Sunday after the Resurrection of Christ, and until the Descent of the Holy Spirit. This tier is typical only for the iconostases of the Zhovkva school of the 1680s&ndash;1750s, and those related to it. These scenes are: the Doubting of Thomas, the Women Myrrhbearers at the Lord&rsquo;s tomb, the Healing of the paralytic, Christ and the Samaritan woman, and the Healing of the blind man. The last image, for the sixth Sunday, was illustrated with a scene from the history of the Church: the Appearance of Christ to St. Peter, Patriarch of Alexandria, which confirmed the teachings of the Holy Fathers on the Eucharist.<br />\r\nRutkovych added two more scenes to the Sunday-Pentecostal tier: Christ appearing to Mary Magdalene in the guise of a gardener and the Road to Emmaus. Both images are from the Paschal period, but they don&rsquo;t belong to the Sunday-Pentecostal cycle. Probably they were added because Rutkovych wanted to have equal width of the tiers in the iconostasis. Most of the images in these two tiers, as well as some scenes from the festal tier and the Passion scenes, were borrowed from Western European engravings. Certain compositions (the Healing of the Paralytic, Christ appearing to Mary Magdalene in the guise of a gardener, the Descent from the Cross) emulate the works by Antonie Wierix, Marten de Vos, and Egbert van Panderen. Some patterns of Western European masters could be borrowed from the printed Bibles by Gerard de Jode and by Piscator that were popular in the 17th century among local professional artists. Thus new iconography started to appear in iconostases, connecting East and West.<br />\r\nAnother exceptional feature of the iconostasis program is that Rutkovych added the images of St. Constantine the Great and St. Volodymyr the Great as co-apostles to the De&euml;sis tier. This is the only known example of such a De&euml;sis. The cult of the saints of Kyivan princes, in the 17th century, was developed by theologians and professors of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy in the context of state-building. Rutkovych or the Basilian monks for whom the iconostasis was created, favored the cult of the holy princes. But it is also worth noting that St. Constantine was probably the patron saint of prince Constantine Sobieski, who inherited the Zhovkva palace after the death of his father, king Jan III Sobieski (1629&ndash;96). Zhovkva, for whose church the iconostasis was created, was one of the residences of the king.<br />\r\nAnother nuance of the iconography of the iconostasis is that the centurion Longinos from the Crucifixion group at the top of the iconostasis is depicted with the features of the aforementioned king Jan III. The Sobieski family supported the Basilian monasteries, presumably including the one in Zhovkva. This may have been the reason for the inclusion of the portrait of Jan Sobieski in the iconostasis.<br />\r\nIn addition to the portrait of Jan Sobieski, the iconographic program of the ensemble includes St. John the Baptist, who could have been the patron saint of the king and of the artist who executed the icons, Ivan Rutkovych. Besides the icon of the Baptism of Christ in the sovereign tier, another poorly preserved icon in this tier represents the beheading of St. John the Baptist. Two icons with his image are in the additional tier of the iconostasis. Interestingly, this image complements the scenes in the prophetic tier of the iconostasis. In the prophetic tier of Ukrainian iconostases, the image of St. John the Baptist was not included, so the Zhovkva iconostasis also stands out in this regard. The paired image with St. John the Baptist in the prophetic tier is Adam holding a large apple. Thus Rutkovych showed the first and the last representatives of the Old Testament.<br />\r\nBesides the iconography, the iconostasis is noteworthy for the high level of icon painting and carvings (the author(s) of the carving are unknown). Ivan Rutkovych is considered the best representative of the Zhovkva school of icon painting and church art of that time. He was a master of color, with various shades of red skillfully combined with the golden background of the icons and the golden carving of the deep frames and cornices of the iconostasis. In the images of the saints, we see a subtle play of light and shadow. Rutkovych also skillfully painted landscapes and ornaments on the clothing of the saints. The icons and the structure of the iconostasis show noticeable Baroque features, so the ensemble is considered one of the best examples of early Baroque art in the region. This visual vocabulary is evident in the development of the tall and monumental iconostases of the central Ukrainian churches during the Cossack period.<br />\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nSvientsytska, Vira. <em>\u0406\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0420\u0443\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0456 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0437\u043c\u0443 \u0432 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u044f\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0456 XVII \u0441\u0442</em>&nbsp;[<em>Ivan Rutkovych and the formation of realism in Ukrainian painting of the 17th century</em>].

    "text":"<p><em>By Roksolana Kosiv | Lviv National Academy of Arts, Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv, Ukraine</em><br />\r\n<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />\r\nThe icon painting collection at the Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv is the largest that represents the development of Ukrainian icons since the 15th century. It consists of over 4,000 objects. The icon collection is the most valuable asset of the museum and forms the basis of the permanent exhibition (closed during the current and ongoing war). Significant collections of similar icons from the 15th&ndash;17th centuries are also held in the Historical Museum in Sanok, the Museum of Folk Architecture in Sanok, the Museum of the Przemysl Land in Przemysl (all in Poland), and the National Art Museum of Ukraine in Kyiv.<br />\r\nThe collection of icons at the National Museum in Lviv dates to the museum&rsquo;s founding in 1905. Medieval icons that were previously located in churches and were no longer used for display became the main target of staff expeditions in the first decade of the museum&rsquo;s operation. According to the old Christian tradition in Ukraine, consecrated church items, including icons that were no longer used, were burned by parishioners to prevent them from being desecrated. According to Metropolitan Andrei Sheptytskyi, the founder of the National Museum in Lviv, one such story became the reason for the museum&rsquo;s establishment. Andrey (in baptism Roman) Sheptytskyi from the noble Sheptytskyi family, when preparing to take the vows in the Basilian Monastery in Dobromyl in the 1880s, saw how parishioners were preparing to burn old icons near the church in the village of Polyana. Andrei Sheptytskyi requested these 15th&ndash;16th century icons, and thus they became one of the first acquisitions of the newly established museum.<br />\r\nThe collection of icons&nbsp;covers a relatively narrow geography, which is due to the limitations of expeditions during that time period. The oldest icons, dating between the late 13th and the 18th centuries, mainly come from the churches of the Ukrainian (then Rus&rsquo;ka) dioceses of Peremyshl (now Pszemysl in Poland) and Lviv. These are now part of the Lviv region of Ukraine and the south-western part of Subcarpathian, and a small part of Lesser Poland voivodeships in Poland. Most of the icons belonged to rural churches, some to churches in towns or monasteries in Peremyshl, Lviv, Lavriv, Spas, Zdvyzhen, Skyt Maniavskyi, Zhovkva. A relatively small number of icons represent the Central Ukrainian, Volyn, and Transcarpathian centers of icon painting of the 17th&ndash;18th centuries.<br />\r\nThe study of the icons in the collection of the National Museum in Lviv raises a number of questions. The oldest icons (more than 200 objects) from the 13th to the middle of the 16th centuries are anonymous (without the signature of the artist) and rarely have a date of creation. Consequently, questions arise regarding their moment of creation, and the identity of the center or artist who painted them. To this day, there are discrepancies, often significant (up to a century), in scientific and popular literature regarding the dating of the oldest icons. These icons were painted with tempera on wooden boards, mainly on linden wood, less frequently on boards made of coniferous trees (pine, fir, spruce). Chemical methods of wood analysis, including dendrochronology, provide insignificant results, as there is no exact dating scale for linden wood in this region. Some comparison could be made with miniatures of manuscripts or frescoes, but few have survived from the 15th century.<br />\r\nFrom the mid-16th to the end of the 19th centuries, there are more icons with dates of creation and, occasionally, with the names of the artists (more than 200 objects), which facilitates the attribution of undated and anonymous works. Visual examination allows scholars and museum curators to identify related objects by style of painting and iconography, which helps to determine their possible origin in one painting center or author. Archival documents of the 15th&ndash;17th centuries contain relatively many names of icon painters who worked in larger and smaller towns of this region, but rarely can they be associated with preserved objects.<br />\r\nIn particular, in Peremyshl, which is considered to be the leading center of icon painting in the 15th and the first half of the 16th centuries, more than 15 names of icon painters were found in documents, but we do not know their art works. It is interesting to note that most of these icon painters were priests. Thus, we can say that the old tradition has been preserved here, according to which icon painting was associated mainly with the clergy. It is believed that in the 16th centuries, the center of icon painting was located at the Lavriv or Spas monastery (the monastery in Spas was closed by the Austrian authorities at the end of the 18th century), as well as at the monastery in Peremyshl. It is assumed that some of the icons from the collection of the National Museum in Lviv, dating from the 15th to the middle of the 16th century belonged to the Peremyshl icon painting center.<br />\r\nThe activity of icon painters in the 17th&ndash;18th centuries is much better documented than that of earlier periods. Here, the leading masters of icon painting were representatives of the Lviv and Zhovkva schools: Fedir Senkovych, Mykola Petrakhnovych, Ivan Rutkovych, and hieromonk Yov Kondzelevych, to name a few key figures. Their works are represented in the collection of the National Museum in Lviv. In particular, two of the most valuable iconostases that reflect the development of high iconostasis in the western Ukrainian lands is preserved here &ndash; the Zhovkva iconostasis, painted in 1697&ndash;1699 by Ivan Rutkovych for the local monastic church, and the Bohorodchany iconostasis, painted by Yov Kondzelevych in 1698&ndash;1705 for the monastic church in the Skyt Maniavskyi (the monastery was closed at the end of the 18th century and the iconostasis was sold to the church in Bohorodchany).<br />\r\nThe icons in the collection of the National Museum in Lviv have been the subject of several scientific catalogs that classify works by iconography or time of creation, as well as several monographs and album publications. The icons in this collection are valuable for the study of the history of Ukrainian icon painting, which existed at the intersection of two great cultures &ndash; Eastern and Western \u0421hristian.<br />\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nThe study of icons from the collection of the Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv raises questions about dating, sources, and analogies in iconography, the activities of different icon painting centers and individual masters, the interplay between various art forms, including manuscript miniatures and icons, and the impact of engravings, both Western European and from local printing presses, on icon painting. Through the icons in the collection of the Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv, one can trace how local masters adapted the Byzantine tradition and responded to the new challenges of the Renaissance and Baroque periods.<br />\r\nThe oldest icons from the late 14th to the early 16th centuries are the most valuable and the most difficult to attribute. These are the icons of St. George the Dragon Slayer and the Synaxis of Joachim and Anne, which come from the church in Stanylia (Lviv region). The icon of the Synaxis of Joachim and Anne dates to 1466, although in scientific literature this date was considered later than the icon itself. The icon of St. George, as well as the Synaxis of Joachim and Anne, are often attributed to the late 14th century. To the early 15th century dates the group of the oldest icons from the church of St. Paraskeva in Radruzh (Poland), which probably belonged to one workshop. These icons reflect the tendencies of local icon painting of the 15th century, oriented toward the Byzantine tradition, however, one icon &ndash; the Ascension of Christ &ndash; stands out with its Romanesque-Gothic influences. A group of icons from the churches in Vanivka and Zdvyzhen, which probably belonged to one Peremyshl workshop, is painted in a light color palette with a semi-transparent layer of paint and has features of the Palaiologan style of Byzantine icon painting. Among them, the icon of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross with biblical scenes stands out, which originally probably belonged to the iconostasis of the church in Zdvyzhen (the name of the village apparently derives from the name of the monastery in honor of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross). Some late 14th to the early 16th centuries icons have a cyrillic inscription of a Greek word &ldquo;a\u0433\u0438\u043e\u0441&rdquo; (&ldquo;saint&rdquo;) which also testifies to the Byzantine connections (e.g. the icon of St. George from Stanylia). Later most inscriptions have abbreviation of Slavonic word &ldquo;\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0439&rdquo; / &ldquo;\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0430&rdquo; (&ldquo;saint&rdquo;). The churches of the Lviv and particularly the Peremyshl eparchies were the western edge of Ukrainian Orthodox culture, bordering the Catholic sphere. By adapting rituals and church art from the Byzantine environment, local medieval iconography was oriented toward the Eastern Christian tradition. However, there are some icons of the 15th and 16th centuries that show noticeable elements of Gothic and later Renaissance styles.<br />\r\nIcons from the 15th and 16th centuries demonstrate that artists often used common patterns. It was typical for the local tradition to depict the icon of the Virgin Hodegetria with prophets, hymnographers, and the parents of the Virgin on the borders. The Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv preserves about 60 icons of this type, whose large sizes indicate that they belonged to the iconostasis. The prototype for the image of the Virgin with the Christ Child was likely a replica of the miraculous Hodegetria icon from Constantinople. One of the oldest icons of this type in the museum&rsquo;s collection, from the church in Pidhorodtsi (Lviv region), has the inscription &ldquo;Hodegetria&rdquo; in cyrillic (&ldquo;&omega;\u0434\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0456\u0454&rdquo;). In the iconostasis, paired with the Virgin Hodegetria, were icons of Christ Pantocrator standing in full-length or Christ in glory surrounded by angelic forces and symbols of the evangelists. The museum has over a dozen icons of Christ Pantocrator in full-length from the 14th to 16th centuries, and 32 icons of Christ in glory. In addition, during the medieval period, the images of St. Nicholas and St. Paraskeva (the Great Martyr and Venerable) were highly revered. The museum has about 30 icons of St. Nicholas with life scenes of the 15th &ndash; 16th centuries, most of which apparently also belonged to the sovereign tier of the iconostasis.<br />\r\nIn the first half of the 17th century, local iconography underwent quite radical changes in terms of style and technique, which are evident in the icons from the collection of the Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv. At that time, masters borrowed patterns from Western European works, mainly engravings. Therefore, perspective, volumetric painting of figures, naturalistic landscapes or interiors appear on the icons. The technique of icon painting involves oil painting on top of tempera, which allows for modeling of forms. New painting techniques are noticeable in the iconography of icons from iconostases, as well as large-format icons of the Passion of Christ and the Last Judgment.<br />\r\nIn particular, the icon of the Last Judgment of 1662 from the church in Medenychi (Lviv region) depicts God the Father in a tiara and Christ sitting on a throne, which is a visual scheme adapted from Catholic iconography. In the 17th century, icons painted on canvas began to appear, which often served as an alternative to wall-painting or the upper tiers of the iconostasis. Examples of such icons can also be seen in the museum&rsquo;s collection. Groups of icons from the second half of the 16th &ndash; 17th centuries from the museum represent the activities of various painting centers and schools: Sambir, Sudova Vyshnia, Mushyna, Rybotychi, Lviv, Kamianka-Buzka, and Zhovkva, to name a few examples. Based on the style of the painting, part of the icons in the museum&rsquo;s collection are attributed to an unknown artist or painting workshop whose location is unidentified.<br />\r\nThe icons of the Andrei Sheptytskyi National Museum in Lviv showcase the evolution of Ukrainian iconography from the 14th century. Through the works in this collection, the impact of Byzantine art on local iconography in the 14th&ndash;16th centuries can be traced. One can determine the priorities of local iconographers and artists, and identify how the impact of Renaissance and Baroque styles was reflected. Research on the icons in this collection is also relevant in the context of the impact the local iconography had on the art of neighboring cultures across Eastern Europe. The museum is currently engaged in ongoing efforts to identify and compare the icons in their collection with those in other museums and churches to help contextualize and further analyze their holdings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nHelytovych, Maria. <em>\u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0446\u044f \u0437 \u0414\u0438\u0442\u044f\u043c \u0456 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u044e. \u0406\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0456\u0457 \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0456\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u044e \u0443 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0456</em>&nbsp;[Theotokos with Child and Praise.

    "text":"<p><em>By Viktor Filas | Khortytia National Academy, Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nMangup-Kale is the largest medieval fortress within the group of so-called &ldquo;cave towns&rdquo; of the South-Western Crimea. The first settlements on Mangup-Kale appeared at the end of the 3rd century. This territory continued to be inhabited until the end of the16th century. The fortress is located on the top of an isolated plateau about 600 m above sea level. The total area of Mangup is about 90 hectares, which is limited on all sides by vertical rocky cliffs with a depth of 30 to 70 m. From the north, the Mangup plateau is cut by three deep gorges with four protruding rocks. There is only one connecting road and several paths laid along the bottom of the gorges from the Karalezka valley that can be used to climb to the settlement. Abundant streams originate in the upper reaches of the beams. The high degree of natural protection, the vast size, and the presence of water sources were the main reasons for the adaptation of this rocky plateau of the Crimean foothills as a fortification and settlement.<br />\r\nThe most common version of the origin of the name &ldquo;Mangup&rdquo; has come down to us in the Ottoman legend, retold by the traveler Evliya &Ccedil;elebi in 1665. He wrote: &ldquo;Even after the Crimean country was conquered, this fortress was in the hands of the infidels for seven years. Gedik Ahmed Pasha put so many soldiers here that because of this he himself died from the wrath of the Sultan. Therefore, this fortress was called in Turkish menk&ucirc;p &ndash; that is, &ldquo;ill-fated&rdquo;.<br />\r\nIn the history of the Christianization of the outskirts of the Byzantine Empire, the Mangup settlement played a paramount role. Already from the moment the region was included in the zone of political influence of the Byzantine Empire in the 7th century, the settlement quickly turned into one of the most important centers for the spread of Christianity. After the emergence of an independent Gothic bishopric on Mangup in the 8th century, which was the territorial unit of the Orthodox Church headed by a bishop, and until the Ottoman conquest of the Crimean peninsula in 1475, there was a cathedral church and the residence of the hierarch of Crimean Gothia. Such a church-administrative status became one of the main reasons for the appearance of many Christian places of worship on the territory of the settlement. Today, within the Mangup plateau, on its slopes and in the nearby mountain valleys, 27 Christian rock and ground temple-burial and monastic complexes have been identified. Among the most significant Christian architectural objects are: Great Basilica, &ldquo;Cruciform Temple&rdquo;, &ldquo;Markevich&rsquo;s Basilica&rdquo;, &ldquo;Church 2015&rdquo;, &ldquo;Church 1967&rdquo;, &ldquo;Church 2005&rdquo;, &ldquo;Southern minor basilica&rdquo;, Northern Cave Monastery, the temple inside the Mangup Citadel, Southern Cave Monastery, churches St. Constantine and St. George. There are also archaeological complexes Almalyk burial ground and the Teshkli-Burun treasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe beginning of the Christianization of Mangup is connected with the beginning of the construction of a Byzantine fortress on the Mangup plateau at the end of the reign of Emperor Justinian I (527&ndash;65). At the same time, the Great Basilica with three naves was built, which served as the administrative and religious center of the settlement. The layout, size, decor, and the separate baptistery, discovered during archaeological research, which began in 1850 and is still being conducted from time to time, indicate that this basilica was likely the center of the episcopal architectural complex.<br />\r\nDespite the support of the Byzantine administration, details about the rapid spread of the new religion in the second half of the 6th &ndash; early 7th centuries remain elusive. There are only two archaeological Christian complexes on the site of this period. In one of the family crypts of the Almalyk burial ground, a carved Christian cross with expanding ends was found. No less interesting is the &ldquo;Teshkli-Burun treasure&rdquo;, which included, in addition to various gold ornaments (jewelry?), a gold cross with a garnet insert.<br />\r\nStarting from the second half of the 7th century, there had been a sharp increase in the size of the Christian community of Mangup. The creation of the Gothic bishopric at the end of the 7th century and the inclusion of Mangup in the Byzantine theme in 841 formed new conditions for the transformation of the sacred space of the city.<br />\r\nIn the southern part of Mangup, early medieval burial grounds ceased to function and two new large religious complexes appeared. These sites had compositional and planning features typical of Byzantine architecture. Since the names of these structures have not been preserved, they are usually called the &ldquo;Cruciform Temple&rdquo; and &ldquo;Markevich&rsquo;s Basilica&rdquo;. These churches, together with the burial complexes of the Great Basilica of Mangup, testify to the &ldquo;Byzantization&rdquo; and the Christianization of the local population. At the turn of the 12th&ndash;13th centuries, new monasteries such as Northern Cave Monastery were built, or the already existing old temple complexes were rebuilt.<br />\r\nAt the end of the 13th century, the Gothic bishopric received the rank of metropolis and a new stage began in the history of the formation of the sacred space of Mangup and its Christian history. This stage was accompanied by the construction of many religious sites and monastery complexes. It is important to note that during this period, Mangup had already left the subordination of Byzantium and was ruled by the ulus administration of the Crimean Yurt of the Golden Horde. In 1395, detailed topographic descriptions of Mangup were made by Hieromonk Matthew, who noted the urban character of the settlement on the Mangup plateau. He mentioned the outer church of the main fortress gate, basilicas, round and domed churches in the central part of the fortress. &ldquo;... I saw outstanding temples, paved with mosaics. And domed, basilic-like and round according to the position (building) of the local metropolis ... as soon as I entered the tower and saw the buildings position, the most beautiful temples and the beauty of palaces, rock-cut tombs, porticos and columns ...&rdquo; To study Mangup, in addition to the archaeological research, written sources are no less important, giving an idea of the variety of monuments of the fortress and containing value judgments of contemporaries about the urbonymic space of Mangup.<br />\r\nModern archaeological research confirms the abundance and diversity of Christian religious complexes that appeared in the Golden Horde period. In addition to the Great Basilica, there were also several above-ground churches in the 13th&ndash;14th centuries. These unnamed places of worship, named after the year they were researched, include &ldquo;church 2015&rdquo;, &ldquo;church 1967&rdquo;, and &ldquo;church 2005&rdquo; with a &ldquo;southern minor basilica&rdquo;. During this period, a significant part of the rock temples and monasteries was also cut down. Among them stand out the North-Eastern Monastery, the garrison church on Cape Teshkli-Burun and the South-Eastern Monastery on the esplanade of the Mangup Citadel.<br />\r\nAs a result of the Crimean campaign of the founder of the Timurid Empire Timur (1336-1406) (or his protege Edigey) in 1395 during the war against the Khan of the Golden Horde Tokhtamysh (1342&ndash;1406), a significant part of Crimea was devastated, including the most important urban centers of the peninsula &ndash; Chersonese, Solkhat, Kaffa, and Mangup. The Mangup churches were completely dismantled, and the burial grounds were abandoned. At the beginning of the 15th century, Mangup became the capital of the Principality of Theodoro (ruling dynasty of the Principality of Theodoro that existed in the Crimea from 1223 to 1475), and its sacred space was significantly altered. The Great Basilica retained its status as the cathedral church of the Gothic metropolis. The temple inside the Mangup Citadel and the Southern Cave Monastery, which were directly related to the ruling dynasty of princes of Theodoro, receive great importance in the life of the city. In the upper reaches of the Kapu-dere and Gamam-dere beams, the churches of St. George and St. Constantine were built, and possibly the &ldquo;church of 1969&rdquo; with necropolises.<br />\r\nAfter the inclusion of the Mangup fortress into the Ottoman Empire in 1475, the ethnic and confessional composition of the population was changed, as well as the sacred topography of the city. According to the defter (registry of population, land and income) of 1520, by the beginning of the 16th century Muslim, Armenian, Jewish, and Greek Orthodox communities lived side-by-side. The Christian community was half of the city&rsquo;s population and consisted of six quarters. Each quarter had its own church and necropolis. The results of archaeological research so far speak of only two churches, which had been already mentioned &ndash; St. Constantine and St. George.<br />\r\nBy the end of the 16th century, the Christian community began to decline. The traveler Martin Bronevskij, describing Mangup in 1578, wrote about one active church &ndash; St. Constantine. &ldquo;Now only the Greek church of St. Constantine and another St. George, completely worthless, remain there.&rdquo; By the middle of the 17th century, the defters no longer recorded the Christian population on Mangup. The last-standing churches were dismantled, and the cave churches and monasteries of the city fell into disrepair.<br />\r\nThroughout the entire period of the Middle Ages, Mangup-Kale was one of the most important centers for the spread of Christianity in the Crimean outskirts of the Byzantine Empire. There were the residence and the cathedral church of the hierarchs of the Gothic bishopric of the Constantinople Patriarchate. This fortress played a role in the preservation of Christian traditions in the &ldquo;post-Byzantine&rdquo; time in Crimea, as evidenced by the numerous Christian churches and monasteries discovered over the years during archaeological excavations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Further Reading</b><br />\r\nBarmina, Nadezhda. &ldquo;Arheologicheskoe izuchenie Mangupskoj baziliki v 1850&ndash;1930-e gg.

    "text":"<p><em>By Alina Kondratiuk | National Academy of Managerial Staff of Culture and Arts (Kyiv, Ukraine), National Preserve &ldquo;Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra&rdquo;</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nChrist in Glory is an icon from the second half of the 16th century from the region of Galicia. This region is a historical and geographical region in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, including modern southeastern Poland and western Ukraine. The icon measures 124,0 &times; 93,0 &times; 2,4 cm in its current condition. Its size indicates that it was designed to be displayed in the sovereign tier of iconostasis.<br />\r\nChrist is presented here as Pantokrator, the King of Glory, Teacher, and Judge. He is enthroned and depicted in triple radiance. He blesses with His right hand and holds an open Gospel book in His left hand. His figure is wrapped in red diamond-shaped radiance inscribed in a blue mandorla. Within the mandorla, the Heavenly Powers are represented, including both seraphim and cherubim. Its oval is imposed on a concave red rectangle that has symbols of the Evangelists depicted in its corners. The feet of Christ are placed on a footstool depicting the Heavenly Powers in the shape of winged rings full of eyes.<br />\r\nThe icon comes from the Eastern Christian church of the Intercession of the Virgin in the village of Matche, Chelm region&nbsp;(Chelm is a city in southeastern Poland). At the end of the 19th century, the icons were stored in the Chelm Church-Archaeological Museum at the Orthodox Brotherhood of the Holy Mother of God. After the Second World War, the icon was transported to Kyiv, and since 1945 it has been kept in the collection of the National Preserve &ldquo;Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra&rdquo;.<br />\r\nThe icon was painted on wooden boards using the tempera technique on gesso. The color of the icon is based on a combination of red, blue, and brown. It is enriched with the light of golden assists on the folds of Christ&#39;s clothes. A carved gesso ornament is placed around the perimeter of the icon and on Christ&#39;s nimbus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe Christ in Glory icon is an outstanding work of art of Ukrainian artistic and spiritual culture. In the history of Ukrainian iconography, the 16th century is the period of gradual departure from centuries-old traditions of Byzantine art and the transition to the new artistic and imaginative system. Nevertheless, the Christ in Glory icon is an example of a local 16th-century icon painting that appealed to strict dogmatic teaching. It shows that Hesychast ideas, common in Byzantine and Eastern Christian countries during that period, were also known in the regions of Ukraine in the 16th century. Only in Kyiv, aside from other Ukrainian cities, there were five cave monasteries that were functioning as the centers of this Christian teaching.<br />\r\nThe icon displays a triumphant image. It embodies the idea of Tabor Light central to Hesychast ideals. This &ldquo;uncreated&rdquo; nature of the Light of Tabor is symbolized by aureoles of different configurations around the figure of Christ. The icon is a distinguished work of art entered into the State Register of National Cultural Property of Ukraine, has exceptional cultural value, as well as historical, artistic, and scientific significance. It is an example of the almost lost Ukrainian artistic heritage of the 16th century from the \u0421helm region. The origin of the icon from the church of the village of Matche was documented, which is rare for the monuments of the 16th century.<br />\r\nThe village of Matche is located on the western bank of the Bug River, 40 km from the city of Chelm. An Orthodox Church&rsquo;s parish is mentioned in a document from 1535. In 1619, the parish became Uniate. Archival information about the church itself is brief and begins only in 1767. It is known that due to the dilapidation of the temple, a new church of the same dedication was built in 1775. In 1875, when this region of Poland became a part of the Russian Empire, the parish became Orthodox again. The Russians built a second new church in 1909-1911. Both churches were destroyed before World War II.<br />\r\nThe icon adapts the style of the so-called mature Palaiologan Renaissance, and its iconography&nbsp;is connected with the development of Ukrainian iconostasis of the 16th century. It has been proven that the icon was intended for the sovereign tier of iconostasis, although until recently it was believed that the &ldquo;Christ in Glory&rdquo; icons were to be presented in the De&euml;sis tier. This hypothesis was proven through the analysis of a number of Ukrainian iconostases of that time and archival materials about iconostases that have not been preserved. In many cases to the right of the Royal Doors was placed the icon of Christ in Glory, and to the left - the icon of the Mother of God with Praise.<br />\r\nThe color of the icon is enriched by the shine of golden highlights on the folds of Christ&#39;s garments, which is a distinguishing feature of Ukrainian icon painting of this period. The ornament carved in gesso around the perimeter of the icon and on Christ&rsquo;s nimbus was typical of the period for the Galician region. The text in the Gospel book in the Hand of Christ is written in Church Slavonic. This is a quote from the Gospel of Matthew (Matt. 25:34b). It says: &ldquo;Come, you who have the blessing of my Father, into the kingdom made ready for you before the world was&rdquo;.<br />\r\nAnalogies to the icon by origin and style are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) the &ldquo;Christ in Glory&rdquo; icon from the village of Zhuravyna (beginning of the 16th century, Lviv National Museum);</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) the &ldquo;Christ in Glory&rdquo; icon from the village of Korostno (2nd quarter of the 16th century, Lviv National Museum);</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) the &ldquo;Christ in Glory&rdquo; icon from the village of Liskovate (2nd quarter of the 16th century, Lviv National Museum);</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4) the &ldquo;Christ in Glory&rdquo; icon of unknown origin (1st half of the 16th century, Lviv National Museum).<br />\r\nThese related icons help us trace the development of the iconography of this subject and the stylistic changes that took place during the 16th century in the &ldquo;Christ in Glory&rdquo; icons. This work allows us to understand some specific features of the Early Modern Ukrainian icon and to realize its fundamental difference from the icons of other regions of Europe, where the Orthodox religion was widespread.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\n<em>The Glory of Ukraine: Sacred Images from the 11th to the 19th Centuries</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Ioannis Siopis |&nbsp;Ionian University</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe katholikon at Cozia Monastery, located in Calimanesti (Romania), is dedicated to the Holy Trinity. It was erected between 1387 and 1391 by the Voivode of Wallachia Mircea the Elder (r. 1386&ndash;95 and 1397&ndash;1418). Its three-niche architectural structure and the facades&#39; decorations are representative examples of the Morava architectural style that is characterized by the splendor of the sculptural elements. The katholikon was used by the royal family of Wallachia as a mausoleum. The interior of the katholikon is decorated with frescoes depicting extensive image cycles dating to 1390, while constant renovations over the centuries have preserved them to an appreciable degree.<br />\r\nWithin the extensive decoration, three narratives see the inclusion of heretics: the Vision of Peter of Alexandria, the Ecumenical Councils and the Last Judgment. In the representation of the Vision of St. Peter of Alexandria, in the narthex, the tightly coiled body of Arius is identifiable inside the dragon&rsquo;s jaws as he is ready to swallow him. Arius wears priestly vestments and an omophorion on his shoulder. Next to the theme of the Vision of the St. Peter of Alexandria is the Second Ecumenical Council. In front of the Byzantine emperor and the episcopal council, a holy Orthodox hierarch with a halo has a conversation with a group of heretical priests, while one of them pulls with his hands his full beard as an indication of frustration. In the exterior imposing mural of the Last Judgment on the west wall of the katholikon (exonarthex), a group of heretics floats on the fiery river while an angel sinks them deeper with a trident.<br />\r\nIn the depictions of the Last Judgment, heretics are usually represented individually or in small groups being swept along with other sinners into the fiery river and ending up in the open mouth of hell. The heretics (e.g., Arius, Macedonios, etc.), together with the Roman emperors, persecutors of Christianity (e.g., Diocletian), are the only named historical figures among the multitude of anonymous sinners in the theme of the Last Judgment.<br />\r\nThe theme of the Vision of Peter of Alexandria derives from the narration of the vita of the bishop of Alexandria, - Peter, who was martyred during the persecutions of Roman emperor Maximian (first quarter of 4th century). According to the narration of his martyrdom, while he was in prison, as he was celebrating the Holy Eucharist, Christ appeared to him in the form of a child wearing a ragged tunic. When Peter asked him who it was that tore his tunic, Christ replied that Arius was responsible for this dishonorable act and urged him not to allow the heretic to partake in the Holy Communion as he did not truly repent even though he asked Peter to be accepted back to Church. The narrative of the Vision emphasizes the strict observance of the Church&#39;s rules regarding the exclusion of heretics from communion. It is an epiphany that refers to the schism and division caused in the body of the Church by the heresy of Arius as the Byzantine theologians associated the Vision of Peter with the separation of the three persons of the Holy Trinity. The representation of the Vision is introduced in the wall paintings of churches from the beginning of the thirteenth century with a tendency to generalize from the fourteenth century onward because of the special importance given to it due to its intense doctrinal, eloquent and anti-heretical character.<br />\r\nThe Ecumenical Councils functioned as doctrinal courts that had the exclusive right to judge who was a heretic. Consequently, the concepts of the Council and heresy were closely linked. As a result, this connection became visible in Byzantine iconography because the theme of the Ecumenical Councils constituted the main space for the representation of heretics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nThe selection of these themes is carefully chosen and placed (Last Judgment on the exterior wall, Vision of Peter of Alexandria, and Ecumenical Councils on the wall of the narthex) since the spectator-believer gets a thorough pictorial representation of the basic principles of the orthodox doctrine by entering from the outer space to the interior of the katholikon. In addition, the three themes in combination with the intense theological symbolism of the rest of the murals of the narthex (such as the scenes from the Akathistos Hymn) render them into an anti-heretical iconographic statement in which the predetermined fate of the condemned heretics becomes obvious.<br />\r\nThe inclusion of the representations of heretics in the iconographic programs of the churches of the late Byzantine period is probably related to some doctrinal controversy (e.g. the Hesychast disputes and the issue of the nature of the Incarnation of Christ) or some outbreak of heresy (e. g. Bogomilism). It is worth mentioning that the Athonite monk Nikodemos from Prilep (1320&ndash;1406), defender of Hesychasm (a monastic Orthodox movement), was present and participated in the construction of the katholikon at Cozia. He very likely suggested part or the entire iconographic program, thus conveying the prevailing doctrinal trends of Hesychasm that were popular in the holy community of Mount Athos at that time. It is possible to say that the anti-heretical program of the katholikon of Cozia Monastery is inspired by similar iconographic programs of Serbian churches dating from the same period. For example, the Vision of St. Peter of Alexandria exists in churches such as Gra\u010danitsa (1319&ndash;1321), Matej\u010de (1348/1352) and Zrze (ca. 1350). Also, the representations of the Ecumenical Councils exist in the Church of the Holy Trinity in Sopocani (1280), in St. Achillios in Ariljie (1297&ndash;99), in St. Demetrius in Pe\u0107 (1317&ndash;24), and in De\u010dani (1348).<br />\r\nFurthermore, this careful selection of illustrating strongly anti-heretical themes in the katholikon of Cozia Monastery also has a political connotation. It promotes the idea of a legitimate reign by the grace of God and the defense and promotion of the Orthodox faith and Church by its founder Mirkea the Elder and the members of the dynasty of Basarab in a turbulent and unstable environment. A similar artistic and ideological connection is observed in St. Achilleios in Arilje where the Council against the Bogomils convened by the Serbian king Stefan Nemanja (at the end of the 12th century) is depicted in the type of Byzantine Ecumenical Councils. This mural projects him and the Nemanji\u0107 dynasty as the legitimate successors and defenders of Orthodoxy in Serbia.<br />\r\nAt Cozia, the adoption of popular anti-heretical themes coincides with the established position of the spread of Byzantine architectural types and practices in the Balkans in the late 14th century. In other words, Byzantine architectural standards and iconographic themes informed the construction and decoration of the most important churches in the region north of the Byzantine Empire and inevitably received intense cultural influences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nKoukiaris, Silas. &ldquo;The depiction of the Vision of Saint Peter of Alexandria in the sanctuary of Byzantine churches.&rdquo; <em>Zogra</em>f 35 (2011): 63&ndash;71.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">In the article, the author thoroughly presents the development and formation of the iconographic theme of the Vision of Peter of Alexandria through the historical, theological, and artistic progress that took place between the 13th and 15th centuries.</p><p>Siopis, Ioannis. &quot;The Representations of the heretics in Byzantine art&quot; (in Greek).

Walter concludes that the heretic appears as an inferior person, as a victim, and as a defeated enemy who is humiliated, trampled, or devoured by the dragon of hell. For Walter, the heretic is rarely a portrait with its own characteristics as in most cases it is complementary to broader iconographic themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This contribution was sponsored by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://maryjahariscenter.org/\"><strong>Mary Jaharis Center for Byzantine Art and Culture</strong></a>&nbsp;at Hellenic College Holy Cross.</p>",

    "text":"<p><em>By Oleksandr Halenko | Kyiv School of Economics, Ukraine</em><br />\r\n<strong>Overview</strong><br />\r\nChungul Kurgan is one of thousands of burial mounds (<em>kurgan</em>) left by the pastoral nomads in the Ukrainian Steppe. In 1981, together with some other kurgans, located near village Zamozhne, Zaporiz&rsquo;ka oblast&rsquo;, it was excavated and removed according to the irrigation plans of Soviet government. It was unimpressively 5,8 m high and 68 m in diameter, while the tallest mounds, built by the Scythians, surpassed 20 m height. Yet discovery of an elite burial underneath made it famous and brought the name after the small river Chingul, which it overlooked from the right bank. The burial was collectively attributed to the K\u0131p&ccedil;aks, the confederation of nomadic tribes of Turko-Mongolic origin that dominated the western half of the Eurasian Steppe (known as <em>De\u015ft-i K\u0131p&ccedil;ak</em> the K\u0131p&ccedil;ak Steppe) since the 11th century until the Mongol conquest in 1240. The name Chungul follows closely the original name of the river, etymologized as Turkish <em>&ccedil;&ouml;ng&uuml;l </em>(meaning &ldquo;quagmire&rdquo;).<br />\r\nThe excavation, carried out with laudable care, determined that Chungul Kurgan was a complex memorial structure, built in several stages. The very choice of the site demonstrates careful planning, as it fell on an ancient kurgan 1,5 m tall that already contained nine burials spanning from Eneolithic to the Late Bronze Age. The construction began with the encircling of the ancient kurgan by the ritual moat, interrupted by several passages. After that, on the perimeter of the old kurgan a massive 6 m tall circular rampart was built out of the blocks of sod. The five gaps led through the rampart inside the encircled area. There is a 5 m deep spacious grave pierced through the center of the old kurgan. Upon the interment and sealing of the grave the interior of the rampart was filled up with soil in two stages. Each of the last two stages was marked by the building of a structure with stone pavement, which must have been in service for a considerable period of time. Shards of purposely broken ceramic, ashes, fragments of stone platforms, as well as human and dog remains indicated the ritual feasting at every stage of the construction.<br />\r\nThe completed memorial formed a round platform with a flat top up to 45 m in diameter and steep sides. One or more stone statues and horse scare-crows must have complemented the scene. Over the past centuries erosion filled up the trench with soil, rounded and somewhat lowered the platform giving it usual domed appearance. The statues were habitually removed by the agricultural settlers in the 19th century.<br />\r\nAlthough the burial suffered from natural decay, it sustained fairly little damage from looters. Already in the distant past treasure-hunters penetrated the mound, despoiled and destroyed one out of five horses, placed around the cover of the grave-pit. Yet this attempt provoked the inner collapse of the mound into the hollow grave-pit that seemingly scared away the robbers and saved the grave from the wholesale pillage. This collapse, however, squashed the coffin together with the objects inside it and messed up the whole interior of the grave. The Next time looters managed to loot and destroy another horse during the excavation in 1981. Doubtless, with the two horses disappeared authentic samples of nomadic artisanry. Yet additionally, as nomads typically sported on their mounts their military trophies, the loss likely included evidence of the historical achievements of the buried person.<br />\r\nLaid to rest in the grave was a man about 55 years of age. Wounds on the skull, healed and fatal ones, bespoke the life and death of a warrior. His body, fully dressed up in richly decorated fur-trimmed silk attire and strewn with precious objects, lying in a huge coffin, covered by the silk standard on the spear. Alongside were placed a big silver gilt covered cup and a belt, several sets of lavish silk garments, decorated with gold embroidery, and a full set of arms, typical for heavy steppe cavalryman, but featuring a dazzle gilded helmet and sheathed in gold and silver quiver and bow-case. Two wine amphoras, a glazed bottle, and a medicinal jar stood by the coffin.<br />\r\nThis rich inventory featured objects of known provenance. The silver gilt covered cup and three belts were West-European artifacts from the 12th-13th centuries. Of the same provenance was the rock crystal, which originally was at the center of an altar cross, but reworked into a decorative pendant for one or the buried horses. The silver gilt belt cup with champlev&eacute; enamel decor was manufactured in Byzantium, as were the amphoras and the bottle. The glazed medicinal jar (albarello) arrived from Islamic Syria. A fragment of embroidered icon showing the donor and eight Cyrillic letters belonged to Christian Slavic periphery of the Byzantine Empire, perhaps Rus&rsquo;. A silk cloth densely decorated in gold embroidery, guilt plaques and showing faces of a saint (St. George), that adorned the outer kaftan on the deceased, likely was the Byzantine imperial regalia, loros, that is known from figural representations, but otherwise has not survived.<br />\r\nBesides notable artistic values, the treasures from Chungul Kurgan provide material evidence for historical phenomena, in particular K\u0131p&ccedil;aks&rsquo; engagement in trade and diplomacy with the Byzantine world, incursions to Rus&rsquo;, and relationships with the rest of Eurasian Steppe.<br />\r\nA large group of items, comprising West-European valuables (3 belts, a covered cup, rock crystal center of altar cross) together with the objects belonging to imperial regalia (like the loros of Byzantine emperors and woven electrum belt of the steppe rulers), reveal for the deceased a victory over the Crusaders and a status of an emperor. Both claims are granted by the unique and well-documented victory that K\u0131p&ccedil;aks gained for Kaloyan of Bulgaria (1197-1207) in the battle near Adrianople (now Edirne, Turkey) in 1205 against the Crusaders under the command of Baldwin I, the first Latin emperor of Constantinople himself. Thus, the discovery of Chungul Kurgan sensationally provides material evidence, linking the region of Ukraine with the Fourth Crusade.<br />\r\nFurthermore, written sources provide arguments for identification of the deceased with Yurii, son of Kon&ccedil;ek, the leader of the K\u0131p&ccedil;ak confederation in Eastern Europe, defeated together with Rus&rsquo; allies by the Mongols army in spring 1223.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nThe discovery of Chungul Kurgan in 1981 provoked a sensation in Ukraine, then a province of the Soviet Union. Although Soviet policy of historical memory was hostile to and neglectful of the Eurasian nomads, another valuable archeological catch refreshed the reputation of the Ukrainian Steppe as a treasure field in the eyes of both the locals and their Russian rulers. The gorgeous silver-gilt covered cup immediately upon discovery was proudly put on display in the local museum in the nearby town of Tokmak. Eventually, all precious metalwork, along with ceramic vessels, became part of permanent exhibition at the Treasury of the National Museum of History of Ukraine.<br />\r\nBut unlike Scythian kurgans loaded with gold, which have been regularly unearthed in the Ukrainian Steppe since the 19th century, the Chungul Kurgan belonged to a completely different economic-metallic world of the High Middle Ages and included only a few objects of solid gold. These quite ordinary chains, wand and rings, were no match to massive, elaborate and exotic Scythian masterpieces, such as golden comb, pectoral, or yet silver amphora. What made this particular burial truly valuable, was not so much richness, as its well preserved and meticulously unearthed setting, which exposed practical and symbolic meaning of each object in perception of the nomads themselves. These items tell us about the personality of the deceased himself, historical events with his participation, his followers, earthly life and burial rituals of the nomads. So rich informative potential together with available written evidence about the K\u0131p&ccedil;aks promised attribution, unthinkable for the ancient Scythian burials.<br />\r\nThe evidence from the objects, however, remained unexplored for over two decades. The experts guessed the date of the burial following personal tastes. Those dealing with ancient Rus&rsquo; associated it with the K\u0131p&ccedil;ak confederation prior to the Mongol conquest of Eastern Europe around 1240, whereas researchers of the post-Mongol period readily included it in their own subject. They all, however, believed that such a rich burial could only belong to a khan, i. e. emperor of the nomads, but nobody voiced the name of the possible candidate. Only Ukrainian archeologist Vitaliy Otroshchenko, who supervised the excavation, assertively associated the deceased with Tegak, a K\u0131p&ccedil;ak leader, whose name was mentioned once in a chronicle of the Western Ukraine sub anno 1252. However, Tegak was neither mentioned as khan, nor even theoretically could bear this title of sovereign ruler under the Mongol rule. Therefore a humble Mongol collaborator hardly suited the candidacy for mighty victor. Unsurprisingly, without sound and impressive attribution the sensation of Chungul Kurgan soon faded.<br />\r\nThe inattention to the finds at the initial stage of debate manifested first of all lack of expertise in history of arts, characteristic of Soviet and post-Soviet humanities. Sadly, this deficiency transpired already during the excavation, as the Moscow-based textile conservator present there due to wildly negligent treatment of the surviving clothing from the burial dismembered now-uncertain number of silk garments. The archeologists and historians superficially attributed the grave goods to material culture of the nomads and therefore often misidentified them. The West-European covered cup, for example, was mistaken for an incense burner of the nomads on account of charred pollen, found inside. An electrum wire-woven belt, put around the neck, was confused with chain, while the straightened golden wand, inserted in the right hand of the deceased, has been interpreted as a scepter. The chrono-typology of West-European belt-buckles and horse stirrups, mistakenly used for dating of Chungul Kurgan to the second half of the 13th century, proved flawed. An egregious example from the work by Ilse Fingerlin &ldquo;G&uuml;rtel des hochen und sp&auml;ten Mittelalters&rdquo; (Munich, 1971), being the belt relic of St. Elizabeth of Hungary, which should be dated prior to her death in 1231. Fingerlin rejects such a dating on the grounds that such buckles do not appear in dateable figural representations until about 1240.<br />\r\nMisidentification of objects also stemmed from disinterest of debate in nomadic culture and turkology. The advocates of the khan status for the deceased, for example, failed to indicate the regalia of the khan&rsquo;s rank, let alone to ponder, whether it reflected the status of the deceased, or simply was a booty, remuneration for service, or a purposefully fabricated token of memory about victory over some emperor. The wand, interpreted as a scepter, is known only as ordinary jewelry. Actually, the one, found in the Chungul Kurgan, belongs to the Bronze Age and is one of many reused objects.<br />\r\nThe reuse of objects was a nonexistent problem for initial debate. This is why Christian sacral objects were misinterpreted as a proof of the Christianity of the deceased. Such is the fragment of the embroidered icon, sewn to the funerary garment, although the tailor cut off the hands of the praying donator figure. A detail of the altar cross, found on the horse, reveals even more pronounced contempt for the Christian religion. In fact, it illustrates the well-documented nomadic habit of decking their mounts with souvenirs of their victories, first attested by Herodotus for the Scythians in Ukraine, with the scalps of slain enemies being the prototype. The first dictionary of Turkish from the 11th century explains the word <em>mon&ccedil;uk</em> as a lion&rsquo;s claw (another honorary trophy) or a jewel, appended on the horse harness. The rock crystal pendant from Chungul Kurgan combines attributes of a jewel with a symbol of personal feat and tells a story of an altar cross that was so much coveted by the K\u0131p&ccedil;aks, that their leader had it disassembled and divided between his associates, reserving for himself the lion&rsquo;s share. Interestingly, the name of the popular Turkish glass talisman <em>boncuk </em>derives from <em>mon&ccedil;uk</em>, whereas another its derivative<em> bun&ccedil;uk</em> in Ukraine referred to the military standard of the Crimean Tatars and Ukrainian Cossacks and represented a horse tail on a stick, thus reminding the prototype. Actually, Chungul Kurgan confirms other descriptions of the nomadic habitus, often dismissed as literary topoi borrowed from Herodotus or other antique authors.<br />\r\nThe group of researchers, consisting of two American art historians and two Ukrainians, one archeologist, and another turkologist, with the support of a Getty Collaborative Grant (2006-2008), initiated the interpretation of the finds. The studies&nbsp;published by this group&nbsp;have brought the rich finds from Chungul Kurgan to the international audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\n<em>Gold der Steppe: Arch&auml;ologie der Ukraine</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Ioannis Siopis | Ionian University</em><br />\r\n<strong>Overview</strong><br />\r\nHeresy, as deviation from the officially recognized Orthodox dogma, caused great upheaval and division in the Church, especially during the early Byzantine period (4th to 7th centuries). It&nbsp;directly and indirectly&nbsp;shaped all manifestations of Orthodoxy such as dogma, cult, hierarchical organization, etc. As a consequence, Byzantine art inevitably captured the figures of the great heretics in its iconography, those who stigmatized ecclesiastical history.<br />\r\nThe first representations of heretics in Byzantine art appear in iconophile manuscripts of the 9th century and after (such as Paris gr. 510 and Chludov Ms. D. 129). From the 11th century onward, their representations are extended to all categories of Byzantine art, and they are also included in specific iconographies that contain rich dogmatic and ecclesiastical symbolisms such as the Last Judgment, the Ecumenical Councils, the Vision of St. Peter of Alexandria, the vitae of St. Spyridon&nbsp;and St. Nicholas, and the Fall of Simon the Magician.<br />\r\nFrom the 14th century onward, and especially during the post-Byzantine period, the heretics tended to be demonized, as heresy was thought to be the result of diabolical actions. Some early examples of this trend are evident in the murals of the devouring of Arius from the dragon of hell, which are included in the theme of the First Ecumenical Council in the church of St. Peter and Paul in Veliko Tarnovo (14th century) and in the Vision of St. Peter of Alexandria in the Monastery of Zrze in North Macedonia (ca. 1350). These themes focus on the clergyman Arius (second half of 4th century) because he was the first important heretic who caused serious problems in the unity of the Church with his teachings about the substance of Christ.<br />\r\nIn scenes of the Last Judgment, heretics are often depicted in two ways. First, they are drifting down the fiery river; and second, they are part of the cursed, which consists of different religious and ethnic groups such as Jews, Muslims, Catholics, Armenians, etc. (especially in post-Byzantine art).<br />\r\nIn the theme of the Vision of St. Peter of Alexandria, which is always represented inside the sanctuary (exceptions are found at the churches of St. Archangels in Prilep and St. Achillios in Arilje), Arius is depicted in two ways. First, the heretic is prostrated on the ground in front of the figure of the little Christ who recognizes him as culpable for&nbsp;the division of the body of the Church; second, as a result of divine punishment, Arius has a dramatic ending since he is being devoured by the dragon of hell. This theme includes intensive anti-heretical meanings as it represents the order of Christ to Peter, bishop of Alexandria,&nbsp;for the exclusion and ex-communication of Arius and all heretics from the Church.<br />\r\nIn scenes of the Ecumenical Councils, the heretics (mainly Arius during the period of the 13th&ndash;17th century) are always represented in opposition to Orthodox figures. They are prostrated and degraded in front of the representatives of the Byzantine state and the Church in a way that references representations of the defeated captives in Roman triumphant reliefs. In some cases, heretics are depicted in small groups conversing with the Orthodox Fathers in front of the emperor. In post-Byzantine Russian icons of the First Ecumenical Councils, the incident of the mythical death of Arius is included, which, according to tradition, took place in the latrines of Constantinople.<br />\r\nThe iconography of the fall of Simon Magus, the first heretic in the history of the Church, recounts Simon&#39;s attempted flight and his crash to the ground after Peter the Apostle intervened. This depiction promotes the victory of the Church over heresy and magic. For an unexplained reason, the representations of the fall of Simon are limited in Byzantine art, and the majority of them almost all derive from the region of southern Italy and Sicily and date between the 11th and 12th centuries.<br />\r\nThe post-Byzantine icons with the theme of the vitae of Sts. Spyridon and Nicholas, who confronted the heresy of Arianism, usually include the events of the First Ecumenical Council during which Nicholas slapped Arius and St. Spyridon transformed the tile in front of the philosopher Eulogios, who was a supporter of Arianism. According to tradition, Nicholas slapped Arius in order to silence him, as he was irritated by the heretical arguments that he was hearing, and St. Spyridon transformed the tile into its three components in order to present to Eulogios the visible example of the union of the Holy Trinity. In some cases, Arius is depicted as being trampled or prostrated in front of St. Spyridon. Some corresponding Western representations are those in which Thomas Aquinas stands triumphantly upon Averroes&rsquo;s prostrated body.<br />\r\nFurthermore, the representations of&nbsp;heretics in illustrated manuscripts (Chludov MS.D. 129 &ndash; 9th century, Pantocrator Cod. 61 &ndash; 9th century, Theodore Psalter Add MS 19352 &ndash; 1066, Barberini gr. 372 &ndash; 11th century, etc.) are characteristic cases in which heretics are depicted with intense negative dispositions that reach the point of indirect ridicule (like caricatures) and sometimes of violent treatment (Codex Basiliensis AN I 8 &ndash; late 12th century).<br />\r\nThe theme of the Persecution of the new Ark, which symbolizes the Orthodox Church, was represented for the first time in post-Byzantine iconography during the 18th century mainly in the wider area of southwestern Ukraine and Romania where religious competition was intense. The Orthodox Church tried to protect its flock from the converting efforts of the Catholics. Characteristic cases are the engravings of the 18th century where various heretics are represented attacking the Ark of the Orthodox Church. Among them are distinguished Catholic priests, Protestants, Jews, and Muslims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nHeretics appear in a multitude of iconographic scenes that&nbsp;are sometimes new and sometimes derived from well-known established patterns found in&nbsp;Roman and Byzantine art (e.g. lex talionis, damnatio memoriae, subversion etc.). Other scenes are based on miraculous events of the Christian tradition (e.g. the fall of Simon the Magician).<br />\r\nIn general, our knowledge about heretics is fragmentary and prejudiced as it derives indirectly from Orthodox anti-heretical writers. The situation is worse in Byzantine art as the original representations of heretics have not survived mainly due to the censorship that was applied by the Orthodox to all the different &quot;heretical&quot; artistic expressions. In art, heretics are either depicted in&nbsp;conversation with the Orthodox Fathers, or&nbsp;humiliated and degraded in front of the ecclesiastical and political principles of the Byzantine state. In extreme cases, they are subjected to corporal violence or face total annihilation as they are being devoured by the dragon of hell. As Christopher Walter argues, heretics are portrayed as inferiors, as victims, and as defeated opponents. In a sense, they are the visual embodiment of the superiority, triumph, and prestige of Orthodoxy. Moreover, at a social level, the above derogatory ways of depicting heretics reinforced the Byzantine perception that they were a foreign part of Byzantine society who were excluded from it and equated with the subordinate categories of subjects of the Byzantine Empire (like Jews).<br />\r\nThe violent depictions of heretics are a reflection, a pictorial expression of the punishments and tortures (such as burning at the stake, being devoured by beasts, mutilations, and disfigurements) that convicts (including heretics) were subjected to under the Byzantine penalty code.<br />\r\nMoreover, as Alessia Trivellone highlights, the dissemination of heretical iconography conforms to the rise of heresies throughout Europe between&nbsp;the 11th and&nbsp;12th centuries&nbsp;(Catharism, Bogomilism, Patarines, Waldensians e.g.) due to a combination of changes in religious, social, and political status. During the same period in Byzantine art, it is noteworthy that although there was an increase in the appearance and action of many contemporary historical persons and groups who were considered heretics, especially during the period of the Komnenian Dynasty, none received pictorial representation. Instead, Byzantine iconography insists on representations of the figures of the great heretics of the early Byzantine period (4th &ndash; 7th centuries). An example is Arius in scenes of the Vision of St. Peter of Alexandria and the Ecumenical Councils, which include heretics in general.<br />\r\nThe intense Triune and Christological controversies (12th century) about the hypostasis of the Holy Trinity and the remembrance of the Incarnation of Christ during&nbsp;Holy Mass renewed the interest in the works of the Great Fathers of the Church who confronted the first big heresies (Arianism, Apollinarism, Nestorianism, Monothelitism e.g.). Along with them, the first great heretics such as Arius, Makedonios, etc., were&nbsp;rediscovered and in art. Their iconographies served as patterns&nbsp;for the representation of heretics from all centuries. This tactic was based on the Byzantine perception that the first great heretics served as idealized types of all heretics in the collective memory throughout the centuries. In this way, the modern heretical apostasy is stigmatized as it becomes equated with the first great sects of Christianity that caused division in the body of the Church.<br />\r\nThe representation of heretics through specific persons (such as Arius, Simon the Magician, and the iconoclastic patriarch of Constantinople John VII Grammarian) who were known in higher theological and ecclesiastical circles for their heretical action, also contributed to the faster and easier demonization of the modern heretics. Therefore, the personification of evil and the division of the body of the Church acquired a personal hypostasis in existing and recognizable personalities of Ecclesiastical History. The tactic of demonizing heretics is observed in Western Europe gradually from the 11th and&nbsp;12th centuries onward, which is expressed visually mainly in miniatures. The same phenomenon is observed in Byzantine art, mainly from the late Byzantine period onward, especially on murals and icons. Two characteristic examples of this new perception are, first, the scene of the devouring of Arius in the Vision of St. Peter of Alexandria and, second, the scene of Arius in the fiery river in the post-Byzantine theme of the Last Judgment.<br />\r\nAlthough past research, like the study of Christopher Walter about heretics in Byzantine art, promoted that there was not a specific iconographic typology of the heretics, through the study of a large number of images of Arius, it is observed that in late Byzantine and post-Byzantine art, there is a tendency of forming a specific iconographic type.&nbsp;In all cases, Arius is portrayed as an old, bearded man with vestments or a simple tunic, either prostrating defeated in front of his victorious opponents or enduring divine justice. In a sense, Arius belongs to the category of iconographic characters that symbolize various social groups or institutions. His figure is established iconographically as it is widely spread, spatially and temporally, with continuous iconographic repetitions in various related anti-heretical scenes&nbsp;in which it maintains a sense of independence. Furthermore, the established iconographic form of Arius inspires the painters to create new variations when conditions require it, for example, the introduction of Arius in the Vision of St. Peter of Alexandria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nCorrigan, Kathleen. <em>Visual Polemics in the Ninth-Century Byzantine Psalters</em>.

This situation testifies to the complexity and the absence of a precise definition of the concept of the heretic in the Western medieval imagination.

    "text":"<p><em>By Tatjana Vuleta | Independent Researcher Vienna, Austria</em><br />\r\n<strong>Overview</strong><br />\r\nIn&nbsp;modern dress history, the caftan is a general term for a medieval coat &ndash; an outer garment that is open in the front along its entire length. The word comes from the Persian word for such robes, <em>\u1e35aft\u0101n</em>. It was adopted in Ottoman Turkish and from there into&nbsp;Slavic languages.<br />\r\nCaftan was neither an original garment worn by Slavic tribes nor part of the Middle Byzantine way of civil clothing that Serbia adopted. The fall of Constantinople to the Latins in 1204, and the ethnic migrations encouraged by the Mongol conquests in the 13th century, brought Serbia a significant change in dress. Wearing caftans of different types came into fashion mainly as a result of Eastern influences. They arrived through Byzantium or were adopted directly from the Asian immigrants and mercenaries who settled in Serbia in the 13th and 14th centuries.<br />\r\nAs an outer garment entirely exposed to the eye, the caftan was used to show the taste, social rank, wealth, official position, and sometimes the ethnic origins of its owner. It was worn by men, women, and children of all societal strata. For the elite, it was made from luxurious textiles, ornamented with gilded embroidery, lined with expensive fur, and adorned with pearls and precious stones.<br />\r\nThere are several types of caftans worn in late medieval Serbia, as detailed below:<br />\r\n<strong><em>1. Kavad</em></strong><br />\r\nThe kavad came to Serbia from Byzantium (Gr. &kappa;&alpha;&beta;&beta;\u03ac&delta;&iota;&omicron;&nu;). It was mentioned for the first time in the mid-13th century. The cut was based on the traditional Persian kaba. It was a long, lightly padded, lined coat, parted in the middle of the front. The sleeves were long and tight, as seen on the portrait of the prince in the \u0110ur\u0111evi Stupovi Monastery (1282/83) and the donors of the Ku\u010devi&scaron;te Church (1332&ndash;37). It was worn with a metal girdle. Following Asian fashion, during the mid-14th century, the kavad developed a version with short sleeves as depicted on donors of the churches in Polo&scaron;ko (1343&ndash;45) and Zemen (ca. 1360). At the same time, the long sleeves received a slit along three-quarters of their length, as recorded on the portraits in Ohrid (St. Pantaleon Church, second quarter of the 14th century and St. Sofia, 1350&ndash;60). It was possible to button up such sleeves, as seen on the donor portraits of the Velu\u0107e Church (1373&ndash;77), but also to wear them entirely or partially open, showing the gown&rsquo;s sleeves, as exemplified by the donors of the Rama\u0107a Church (ca. 1392). At the end of the 14th century, such sleeves could have lacing instead of buttons as depicted on the donor portraits in the Jo&scaron;anica Church (1388).<br />\r\n<strong><em>2. Beshmet </em></strong><br />\r\nThe beshmet came to Serbia with Caucasian refugees during the second half of the 13th century. It was cut at the waistline. Its wide bell-shaped skirt allowed easy movement, which made it especially suitable for riding. It was worn as a high-rank court garment in the early 14th century, as seen on King Stefan the First-Crowned (r. 1196&ndash;1227) represented in the Mother of God Ljevi&scaron;ka Church in Prizren (1309&ndash;13). Beshmets with distinctive ethnic cut and embellishments are worn by Jovan Oliver depicted in the Lesnovo Church (1342 and 1349). That the basic cut of the beshmet was integrated into the clothing of the Serbian nobility as shown by the caftan of the oldest donor in the Jo&scaron;anica Church (1388) and the older part of the recycled caftan from the mid-15th century preserved in the Church of St. Peter near Novi Pazar.<br />\r\n<strong><em>3. &Scaron;uba </em></strong><br />\r\nThe &scaron;uba spread among the Slavs from the Altaic-Mongolian coat \u010duba due to direct contact with the Golden Horde. The Serbian &scaron;uba was made of wool, leather, or ticker silk lined with fur. It had overlong hanging sleeves. Its origin and existence in Serbia from the 14th century onward are confirmed by written sources and fresco depictions as in the monasteries of \u017di\u010da (1309&ndash;16) and Marko (1376/77). The &scaron;uba was worn without a belt.<br />\r\n<em><strong>4. Kontu&scaron; </strong></em><br />\r\nThis term and the garment came to Serbia with the Turkic-speaking peoples (Tur. konto\u015f, kontoz, kontay\u015f). It was a caftan of a specific cut recorded in Serbian fresco painting as early as the second decade of the 14th century. One of the noblemen represented in King Milutin&rsquo;s entourage in \u017di\u010da Monastery (1309&ndash;16) is clad in such a garment. It had overlong hanging sleeves and was worn with a belt. It could have a lighter textile lining, but for the wealthier people it was lined with fur.<br />\r\n<strong><em>5. Deel </em></strong><br />\r\nThe Mongolian deel was present in Serbia but was not integrated into local fashion. It came to Serbia with Golden Horde mercenaries and was a mark of their service and origin. It can be seen in painted form on the supplicant of the Karan Church (1338/39).<br />\r\n<strong><em>6. Zimarra</em></strong><br />\r\nThat late medieval Serbia was a place for the mingling of different dress styles coming from the East and the West is evident in the presence of the Italian zimarra. During the last quarter of the 14th and the first half of the 15th centuries, the zimarra was part of&nbsp;court dress, as seen on Princess Milica in Velu\u0107e Church (1373&ndash;77), the preserved caftan of Prince Lazar, and the Brankovi\u0107 family of the Esphigmen Charter (1429). The zimarra can also be seen on the donor Milica of the Kaleni\u0107 Church (1410s or 20s), made of sumptuous Italian velvets. The zimarra worn by women had a train whose length depended on the social position of the lady.<br />\r\n<strong><em>7. Caftan and Dolama</em></strong><br />\r\nThe gradual Ottoman presence in the Balkans from the second half of the 14th century onward directly impacted Serbian clothing. The first preserved example of the Ottoman kaftanlar is the upper garments of the male donors of the Maligrad&rsquo;s church on Lake Prespa (1368/69). Their short sleeves had oval hanging extensions. The nobles presented in their churches from the second half of the 15th century all wore Ottoman kaftanlar or dolamalar with hanging sleeves and pointed collars. Ottoman caftans were popular in Serbia from the mid-15th until the mid-19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nMedieval dress in Serbia has been considered an important research issue ever since the interest in Serbian medieval history emerged in the second half of the 19th century. It was seen as an important national symbol that would differentiate Serbia from the long-lasting Ottoman rule and connect it again with its medieval cultural and religious roots. The significant number of preserved portraits of church donors from the 13th to the 16th centuries, scarce medieval written sources, and a small number of preserved textiles have been sufficient material to enable thorough research. Nevertheless, a comprehensive and independent study of dress in medieval Serbia has yet to be written.<br />\r\nAs a part of the Byzantine political, religious, and cultural oikoumene, medieval Serbia and its culture, including clothing, have been mainly seen through Byzantine lenses. However, unlike church architecture and fresco painting, dress was a product of much more dynamic and less regulated and prescribed processes, not wholly controlled and designed by religious postulates. Therefore, it was a much more daring reflection of the time when the late medieval Byzantine and Serbian cultures were significantly inflected by the global process of cultural exchange and permeation.<br />\r\nAs caftans in late medieval Serbia were mostly of Asian inspiration, their research suffered from a lack of interest. They were not even recognized as a separate group of garments until a decade ago. When rarely mentioned, they were considered Byzantine court garments that belonged either to the group of court kabbadia or to the granatza and lapatzas gowns. Their shape, color, ornaments, and textile motifs have been used to prove their owners&rsquo; court titles, being constantly squeezed into the known corpus of Byzantine court garments and their court protocols. When their eastern origins were recognized, they were just superficially described without any attempt at analysis or comparative study.<br />\r\nOne such example is the extraordinary caftans of Jovan Oliver, one of the most prominent noblemen of King and Emperor Du&scaron;an Nemanji\u0107&rsquo;s court (r. 1331&ndash;55), represented in his two portraits in the Lesnovo Church (1342 and 1349). His caftans of the beshmet type have distinctively parted skirts and cloud collars of a particular Central Asian style. Being similar to the Caucasian tribal caftans, especially of the Kubachi region, they reveal the possible origins of Oliver&rsquo;s family. Both caftans show that such garments&rsquo; specific cut and ornamentation could have profound ethnic properties other than Serbian. Nevertheless, these caftans are recognized by modern scholars either as the official court kabbadia of Byzantine sebastokrators and despots that led to the further misinterpretation of the origin of Oliver&rsquo;s court titles as Byzantine and not Serbian or as a mere product of Oliver&rsquo;s extravagance.<br />\r\nThe other example is the caftan of \u017eupan Petar Brajan, supplicant of the Karan church (1338&ndash;39). He wears a distinctive Turco-Mongolian deel, parted at the right side, made of Chinese kamkha silk with significant Chino-Mongolian motifs of peony flowers and phoenix birds. Its overlong hanging sleeves are attached to the center of the backside in a Mongolian manner. Yet, this caftan has been defined as a Byzantine court lapatzas made of Italian silk. Brajan&rsquo;s deel shows that the choice of caftan worn in late medieval Serbia could also be determined by the occupation of its owner. It testifies that he was a Golden Horde mercenary employed in King Milutin&rsquo;s army. Such a choice of caftan also raises the question of Brajan&rsquo;s ethnic origin, most probably Cuman. These two examples reveal that not everything worn in Serbia was of a local origin. In fact, most of the material evidence was not Serbian. Yet, a unique mixture of different dress styles and types coming from different corners of the world can be called Serbian.<br />\r\nThe lack of a greater number of preserved textiles used in late medieval Serbia and often not enough detailed pictorial representations or written descriptions of garments made the research of caftans challenging during the 20th century, especially for scholars who had a lack of tailoring and craft knowledge. The low level of dress history research in Serbia without any serious attempt at its scientific development added to the problem. At the same time, the lack of a detailed study of the dress in Byzantium offered from the tailoring perspective, further limited and still limits the scope of the Serbian dress researchers.<br />\r\nOn the other hand, the explosion of new research on Mongol, Chinese, and Central Asian medieval cultures in the first two decades of the 21st century has brought fresh and rich material for research on medieval caftans as garments first connected to the Asian steppe peoples. The preserved caftans offered a much-needed opportunity to study their cut and tailoring features, which offered&nbsp;material for further crucial development of Asian dress tailoring classification and history. That opened up the possibility of researching caftans worn in late medieval Serbia from the point of view of tailoring. Also, the publishing of dictionaries of Central Asian Turkic languages with a detailed etymology offered a resolution to the origins and meanings of the caftan terminology used in Serbia at that time, as preserved in contemporary written sources. That brought a whole set of new valuable results, presented here in short.<br />\r\nFurther research into dress in Byzantium and medieval Serbia (or better said in the Balkans and the wider East European context) requires a carefully devised, comprehensive approach of an interdisciplinary team of experts. During the 14th century, Serbia covered a large portion of the Balkan Peninsula. Regional differences in clothing, including caftans, are evident but not yet studied and explained in detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nVuleta, Tatjana. &ldquo;Garments with Hanging Sleeves: A General Review with Taxonomy of Style and Cut.&rdquo; <em>Patrimonium.MK 13&nbsp;</em>18 (2020): 411&ndash;454.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This is a detailed analysis and systematization of caftans according to the type of cut that includes all types of caftans worn in medieval Serbia).</p><p>Mirkovi\u0107, Lazar. &ldquo;Haljina kneza Lazara.&rdquo; [The Dress of Prince Lazar]<em> Umetni\u010dki pregled</em> 3 (1937): 72&ndash;73.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This is the first and only ess\u0430y on the preserved caftan of Prince Lazar from the second half of the 14th century.&nbsp;</p><p>Temerinski, \u017deljka, and Aleksandra Niti\u0107. &ldquo;Rekonstrukcija vlasteoske haljine iz Petrove crkve kod Novog Pazara.&rdquo; [Reconstruction of the Dress of a Nobleman from St. Perer&rsquo;s Church near Novi Pazar] <em>Saop&scaron;tenja</em> 40&nbsp;(2008): 77&ndash;87; includes a summary in English.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">An analysis of a preserved caftan from the church of St. Peter near Novi Pazar from the middle of the 15th century.</p><p>Vuleta, Tatjana. &ldquo;Lesnovski kavadi Jovana Olivera.&rdquo; [Jovan Oliver&rsquo;s Caftans from Lesnovo] <em>Patrimonium.MK 8</em>&nbsp;13 (2015): 171&ndash;198; includes a summary in English.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This is a detailed stylistic, tailoring, and symbolic analysis of Jovan Oliver&rsquo;s caftans painted in Lesnovo.</p><p>Vuleta, Tatjana. &ldquo;Stade &scaron;kripa \u017eutijeh kavada.&rdquo; [And the Yellow Kabadia Rustled No More] <em>Zbornik Muzeja primenjene umetnosti</em> 7&nbsp;(2011): 17&ndash;30; includes a summary in English.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This is a detailed study of the kavadi worn in medieval Serbia as represented in&nbsp;fresco portraits of church donors.</p><p>Vuleta, Tatjana.&ldquo;Strani elementi u ode\u017edi karanskih ktitora &ndash; otisak sveta kao simbol etnosa.&rdquo; I deo [Foreign Elements of Ktetor Attire in Karan &ndash; the Mark of the World as a Symbol of Ethnos.&rdquo; Part 1] <em>Patrimonium.MK 11&nbsp;</em>16 (2018): 223&ndash;242; includes a summary in English.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This article offers a detailed stylistic and tailoring analysis of Petar Brajan&rsquo;s caftan painted in the White Church of Karan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This contribution was sponsored by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://maryjahariscenter.org/\"><strong>Mary Jaharis Center for Byzantine Art and Culture</strong></a>&nbsp;at Hellenic College Holy Cross.</p>",

    "text":"<p><em>By Samuel D. Gruber and Carol Herselle Krinsky with Diane Wolfthal </em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe free-standing Altneushul (or Old-New Synagogue) in Prague is 15 x 9 m., divided lengthwise into two naves by two octagonal piers, and surrounded by annexes that abut the main hall and appear to have been added in later building phases&mdash;a characteristic subsequently typical of many synagogues throughout Central Europe.<br />\r\nThe earliest addition to the structure is the vestibule on the south side that contains the entrance. Recent excavations have revealed 25 cm. under the existing stone pavement of the entrance hall (the result of the restorations of 1883, 1926, and 1967) a nearly complete original floor made of large limestone slabs. The original stone slabs of the wall foundations were also uncovered. Beneath the stone floor was a layer of plaster and small stones that appears to date from the construction phase of the main hall. Below this was an older and deeper layer of small river stones, perhaps some form of paved walkway that preexisted the present building. If the stratum of plaster and small stones does demarcate the construction area of the main hall, the find refutes the hypothesis that the south annex may, in fact, be the adaptation of an early- or mid-13th-century synagogue building on the site&mdash;predating the Altneushul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe building is the most intact of all medieval synagogues, and because it had remained continuously in use, it is also widely recognized as a symbol of the antiquity and continuity of the Jewish presence in Prague &ndash; and by extension &ndash; the entire region. Because of its fame, the building is also the locus of many legends, including that of the Golem (a frightening effigy brought to life, which protected the Jews of Prague), and this is featured widely in literature and art. Today, along with other buildings in the former Jewish quarter and the Old Jewish Cemetery, it is among the most visited sites in the Czech Republic and may be the most visited Jewish historic and architectural site in the diaspora world.<br />\r\nBecause its medieval fabric remains essentially intact, we know less of the later building history of the synagogue. The construction of the double-nave Gothic building dates to the late 13th century. It is typical of the medieval double-nave plan type of synagogue, known from Worms, Regensburg and elsewhere. The building was subsequently damaged in the pogrom of 1389. The Ark, with its classical columns supported on volute brackets, dates to the 16th century.<br />\r\nThe synagogue&rsquo;s current appearance dates to a restoration of 1716. It was repaired again in 1883, when the architect Joseph Mocker remodeled it. A more complete restoration was carried out by the State Bureau for the Care of Historical Monuments from 1921 to 1926, mostly involving re-plastering and examining the structure. The last interior renovation was made in 1966&ndash;1967. Since the mid-nineteenth century the synagogue has been a favorite subject of painters and photographers.<br />\r\nThe bimah<strong> </strong>(the platform from which the Torah is read) is set between the piers; its wrought iron enclosure with pointed arches presumably dates to the 15th century. The old, beautifully carved Gothic gable that was part of the original Ark has been fitted into the modern one. The synagogue is surrounded by a number of low annexes added throughout its history. Richard Krautheimer dated the main hall to the early 14th century. Zdenka Muenzer and others date the synagogue to the 13th century, sometime after 1254 when King Premysl Ottakar II issued privileges to the Jews of Prague.<br />\r\nNew excavations at the Altneushul were carried out in 1998 under the direction of Zdenek Dragoun, chief of the Archaeological Department of the Prague Center of the Bureau of Monument Care. Most of the excavation work took place in the southern and northern annexes, that is, in the entrance hall and in the women&rsquo;s section on the north side of the building that is believed to date from 1742. The excavations of the west part of the entrance hall suggest that the south and west annexes of the building were constructed separately and only much later joined at the corner. If this clearly demonstrates that the southwest corner is later than the south annex, then another argument is removed for the earlier dating and use of the entrance annex (that it is inexplicably longer than the main hall). This excavation also revealed the south foundations of the main structure, extending at least one meter deep beneath the ground level and made of squared stones. Strong underground buttresses were placed at the corners of the main building. The ground beneath the main sanctuary had been disturbed so much throughout the building&rsquo;s long history and during its many restorations that there was little to find in that area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nGruber, Samuel. &ldquo;Archaeological Remains of Ashkenazic Jewry in Europe: A New Source of Pride and History.&rdquo; In <em>What Athens has to do with Jerusalem: Essays on classical, Jewish, and Early Christian Art and Archaeology in Honor of Gideon Foerster</em>, edited by Leonard Rutgers, 267&ndash;301.

    "text":"<p><em>By Samuel D. Gruber with Diane Wolfthal</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nThe Old Jewish Cemetery is the second oldest Jewish burial ground in Prague and one of the oldest and best-preserved Jewish cemeteries in the world. It is distinctive for its thousands of inscribed and decorated tombstones that are crowded into a small urban space on the edge of the former Prague Ghetto. Since the 19th century, the cemetery has been recognized and much visited as an historic and artistic site and it has often been represented in art. Consequently, most of the site was spared during the demolition and rebuilding of the area of the Jewish Ghetto in the early 20th century.<br />\r\nFounded around 1430, the cemetery was enlarged several times during the 16th and 17th centuries and received new burials until 1787. It was reduced in size in 1903 during the urban renewal of Josefov (the area of the former Ghetto). Due to the lack of space already early in its history, existing graves were covered with earth to allow new burials on top, resulting in many layers of burials, in some places up to twelve layers of graves. When graves were covered, the stones were often raised to the surface level, creating an even-increasing jumble of stones of different eras. Today, there are about 12,000 visible tombstones in the cemetery, but the number of individuals buried is much higher, and many old stones are also certainly buried out of sight. Some tombstones have sunk into the ground, others were left in lower levels, and still others, especially some made of wood, have been destroyed. Stylistically, the stones date from the late Gothic to the Rococo and present a wide range of carving, epigraphic and decorative styles. Several ark-shaped tombs from the 17th and 18th centuries are especially noteworthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe oldest known cemetery in Prague was probably founded in the 11th century in the Mala Strana district on the west side of the Vltava River. No traces remain. The second cemetery, in the district Nove Miasto around today&#39;s Vladislavova street, existed in the 13th - 14th centuries, and was closed after 1477. Fragments of its tombstones were transferred in the 19th century to the cemetery in Josefov. In 1998 the site was excavated during the construction of a large new building; after protests and negotiations, and to honor Jewish law and tradition, some remains were preserved in situ in 2000.<br />\r\nThe extant Old Cemetery was founded by the beginning of the 15th century at the western edge of what was then the ghetto; it served as the main burial ground of the Prague Jewish community for some 350 years. Despite frequent expansions, it was soon unable to cope with the needs of the Jewish community. Jewish custom forbids the disturbance of graves, so Jews rarely, if ever, willingly move bodies from their original burial place. To allow more burials in the restricted locale, earth was piled above old graves for new layers of burials. Jewish law requires that individual graves should be separated by a layer of earth measuring at least six handbreadths, and this regulation was followed scrupulously. Some old tombstones were laid above the burial and covered up; others were instead reset on the new surface level.<br />\r\nThe cemetery is celebrated for the artistry of its tombstones, the literary and linguistic value of many of their lengthy inscriptions, and the number of famous Jews whose graves remain places of pilgrimage. The stones are an encyclopedia of Bohemian funerary motifs, inscriptions, decorative patterns, symbols, and epigraphy over three centuries of Jewish life in Central Europe. Known gravestones include those of scholar and poet Avigdor Karo (d. 1439); rabbi, philosopher, and teacher Yehudah ben Bezalel Low (about 1525&ndash;1609); astronomer and mathematician David Gans (1541&ndash;1613); astronomer and physician Joseph Delmedigo (1591&ndash;1655); and Rabbi David Oppenheim (1664&ndash;1736), whose book collection Oxford University purchased.<br />\r\nNear the East front of the Klaus synagogue, which abuts the cemetery, is an elevation called Nefele where children who had died before the age of one month were buried. In 1903, remains from the demolished parts of the cemetery were interred here and a three-dimensional tombstone commemorating those buried here was erected. Tombstone fragments from an older cemetery on Vladislavova street were embedded in the wall near the Nefele elevation. (The earliest dates from the mid-14th century.) Restoration work has been ongoing since 1946. The Jewish Museum of Prague administers the cemetery, which is open to visitors.<br />\r\nA publication of the Jewish Museum of Prague, based on documents, concludes: &quot;The first written reference to the cemetery mentions that, in 1440, the Jewish Elders purchased an old house with a building lot opposite a brothel, next to the Jewish Garden where the dead are now buried. The next extension of the cemetery occurred in 1526, when Jewish wardens purchased a garden for the burial of the dead, lying alongside their first garden where they have burials. A separate, enclosed burial ground, in the vicinity of the Pinkas Synagogue, also emerged sometime in the first half of the sixteenth century; this is clearly indicated on a map dating from the mid seventeenth century. In 1573 wardens of Jewish schools and hospitals purchased a house with a garden lying towards the riverbank, this evidently became the basis for a separate cemetery. In 1598 Primas Mordecai Maisel purchased a house with a garden, which extended the central part of the existing cemetery towards the west. The cemetery was again extended in 1630, although the two main sections (east and north-west) were not connected until the end of the seventeenth century. The last extension occurred in 1768 with the purchase of land on the south- west edge of the cemetery, although burials no longer took place here. In the end, the Old Jewish Cemetery covered an area of 11,290 nr, almost an eighth of the overall size of the former Jewish Town of Prague.&rdquo; (Pa\u0159ik et al, <em>Prague Jewish Cemeteries</em>, p. 23.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nEhl, P.; Parik, A.; and Fiedler, J.&nbsp;<em>Old Bohemian and Moravian Cemeteries</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Samuel D. Gruber and Carol Herselle Krinsky</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Old (Staary or Alt) Synagogue is located at the end of Szeroka Street in Jewish Kazimierz in Krakow. It is a large double-nave masonry synagogue, probably built after 1494, when Jews were confined to this district, then outside of the capital city of Krakow. The synagogue might have been built before 1519; when there was a dispute between the Polish-born and the native Bohemian Jews for possession of an &quot;old&quot; synagogue, though most likely not this building. The synagogue is the oldest in Krakow, but the last of the double-nave synagogues built in Central and Eastern Europe (others in Germany, Prague, Budapest, Maribor, and finally Krakow). Subsequently, technical and liturgical developments encouraged new forms of synagogue design.<br />\r\nThe original building probably included the main hall, divided into two naves by columns, a porch on the north-west side, kahal (community) and ancillary rooms on the west side, and a small building attached on the south. Today&rsquo;s appearance mostly dates to a rebuilding by architect Mateo Gucci following a fire in 1557 but which has been renovated and rebuilt many times. A pre-fire synagogue building might have had a gabled roof, masonry buttresses, pointed-arch windows, different capitals, and other details, but Gucci created Renaissance interior decoration and an attic story. Around 1600, a women&rsquo;s prayer space was added along the north wall. The present horizontal roofline is created by the arcaded attic, common in Polish Renaissance architecture. Inside are round-headed windows, capitals, and the ark (the cabinet where the Torah is stored)&nbsp;and bimah&nbsp;(the platform from which the Torah is read) with Renaissance forms. A few earlier details survive, including four-part ribbed groin vaults and traces of wall shafts that were replaced by corbels on three interior walls.<br />\r\nIn September 1939,&nbsp;the Germans, who occupied the city, used the Old Synagogue as a warehouse, and subsequently looted and stripped the building of its Gothic vaulting and central columns, leaving it a ruin used as a public latrine. It was rebuilt as a museum after the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nJewish settlement in the Krakow area is documented from 1304. A synagogue was first mentioned in 1356. Polish kings found Jews useful for stimulating commerce, and after a pogrom in Prague in 1389, Bohemian Jews came to Krakow, linking the two centers culturally. Charters established Jews&rsquo; right to have a synagogue. First, Jews lived in Krakow proper, but after a fire in 1494 Jews were required to relocate to Kazimierz, then outside the city.<br />\r\nKazimierz&rsquo;s surviving synagogues, &ldquo;embody the history of an important center of traditional Jewish culture and of Kabbalistic lore, of Jewish law, and of Jewish self-government in the years when Cracow was the seat of the Little Poland district within the Jewish Council of the Four Lands.&rdquo; (Krinsky 1985) Jews probably established a place for prayer soon after 1494. Legend puts the date of the Old Synagogue to the 14th century, but Krinsky believes there were not enough Jews in Kazimierz to warrant building such a large two-nave synagogue. In 1469, two synagogues had been closed in Krakow when the Jews were forced to move elsewhere; nevertheless, as Jews continued to live in Krakow for another quarter-century, there must have been other synagogues available there after 1469, making a large synagogue in Kazimierz superfluous.<br />\r\nTwo-nave buildings existed in Poland since the 13th century (monastic chapter house at Koprzywnica), and 14th-century examples include the convent chapel at Krakow and churches at Stopnica and Wislica. The Kazimierz building, while taller than the Prague synagogue in absolute measurement (10.15 m. compared to 97 m. at Prague), appears to be broader, as is characteristic of Renaissance buildings. The height-to-width proportions are 10.15:17 m. at Kazimierz and 9.7:14.3 m. at Prague. Kazimierz synagogue columns are 60 cm. in diameter, compared to 85 cm. at Prague, and the walls are thinner, indicating a better understanding of statics.<br />\r\nAt Kazimierz, the bimah&nbsp;is prominent as a central polygonal and canopied wrought-iron cage enclosing the elevated platform (the present bimah is a replica). Plans made in the early 20th century show the bimah slightly off-center. For liturgical purposes, Krakow Rabbi Moses Isserles (the ReMu) argued for a central bimah but did require it to be exactly dead center. The ark steps rise between two low wall spurs, as at the Prague Altneuschul.<br />\r\nThe floor of the Synagogue was lower than grade. This was common in many medieval and early modern synagogues where restrictions (implicit or explicit) regulated the height of Jewish buildings. The lower floor level allowed greater interior height. And subsequently facilitated the addition of women&#39;s galleries and other annexes from the 17th through the 19th century. An 1865 painting shows movable seats and lecterns. There were bronze chandeliers (the German commandant of the area during the Second World War confiscated them for his own residence). There were painted inscriptions on the north wall and on the south annex walls, probably added in the late 19th or early 20th century.<br />\r\nThe Old Synagogue was restored in 1773 and reconstructed in 1889. The government-funded conservation work in 1913 and again in 1936. Between 1940 and 1945, the synagogue lost its roof, vaults, furniture, windows, and library collections, and its courtyard was used for Nazi executions. Rebuilding after the war ended in 1959, and the building opened as part of the city historical museum dedicated to Jewish history and culture, but it was more a Communist era showcase of exotica than an informative or educational institution. In May 1982, burglars ransacked the building and stole objects of ritual art. Since the fall of Communism in 1990, the museum has undergone many changes. The labeling of the substantial exhibition of synagogue furnishings and ritual art has improved. The museum hosts exhibitions and concerts in what was the main prayer hall. Even as other synagogues of Kazmeirz have been restored by the Jewish Community - and some returned to religious use - the Staary Synagogue remains a central tourist attraction for visitors in the Old Jewish Quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nDuda, Eugeniusz.<em>&nbsp;A Guide to Jewish Cracow.</em>&nbsp;Warsaw: Our Roots, 1990, esp. 36<span style=\"font-size:11pt; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap\"><span style=\"font-family:'Times New Roman',serif\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\">&ndash;</span></span></span></span></span></span>38.</p><p>Krinsky, Carol Herselle. <em>Synagogues of Europe.</em>&nbsp;Boston: The Architectural History Foundation and the MIT Press, 1985.</p><p>Rejduch-Samkowa, Izabella, and Jana Samka, eds.<em> Catalog of Art Monuments in Poland.

    "text":"<p><em>By Octavian-Adrian Negoi\u021b\u0103 | Institute for the History of Religions, Romanian Academy</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe <em>Bible of \u0218erban Cantacuzino</em>, also known as the<em> Bible of Bucharest </em>(referred to as <em>Bible</em> here), is the first complete translation of the Scripture into the Romanian language. It is one of the most renowned and complex editorial projects that took place during the 17th century in the Danubian principalities. It is a monumental and collective work, whose production began on November 5, 1687 and finished with its publication on November 10, 1688. It comprises 932 pages to which 5 unnumbered ones were added for the prefaces of some biblical books, along with an epilogue. It is printed in Cyrilic script with black and red ink, and with the biblical texts displayed on two columns.<br />\r\nThe red ink was reserved only for parts of the title page - i.e., words <em>Biblia, Dumnezeiasca Scriptur\u0103</em> &ldquo;the divine Scripture,&rdquo; and <em>toate</em> &ldquo;all&rdquo; (to highlight that it is a complete translation of the <em>Bible</em>); the names of Lords \u0218erban Cantacuzino (r. 1678&ndash;88) and Constantin Br&acirc;ncoveanu (r. 1688&ndash;1714), alongside that of Theodosie Ve\u0219temeanu, Metropolitan of Wallachia (1668&ndash;72; 1679&ndash;1708) - and the titles of the Book of Genesis and the Gospel of Matthew, most probably, to mark the beginnings of the Old and New Testaments, alongside the decorated initial letters of their first chapters. All the other texts, ornaments, and lettrines are printed in black ink.<br />\r\nThe ornaments are simple: a floral framing for the title page, and small ornaments placed at the beginnings and the end of the biblical books. The only elaborate decorations are those placed at the beginning of the Book of Genesis and the Gospel of Matthew, and the coat of arms of \u0218erban Cantacuzino, placed after the title page.<br />\r\nThe original binding is in the style of Br&acirc;ncoveanu&rsquo;s period. It is of brown leather stretched on wooden barks, with small locks made of leather straps with metal hooks. The tooling shows wide borders with vegetal and anthropomorphic motifs, as well as fleurons. On the front cover there is a medallion of the icon of Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection, and on the back, also in medallion, the Virgin Mary is represented with the Child, together with the Archangels Michael and Gabriel. The ornaments of the front cover are golden. The spine contains four profiled ribs, ornamented by pressing with gilded phytomorphic bands. The green tranches are printed with gilded plant elements.<br />\r\nAfter the title page, it follows the page rendering the coat of arms of \u0218erban Cantacuzino under which there are 8 verses authored by the Logothetes Radu Greceanu (c. 1655/60&ndash;1725), one of the translators involved in the production of the <em>Bible</em>, explaining the symbolism of the coat of arms. The coat of arms ilustrates a bicephalous eagle with open wings on a round shield surrounded by foliage, with a single crown over its heads, and holding in its legs a sword and a scepter; on its chest there is another heart shaped shield in which it is inscribed a raven with its head turned towards its left wing, with a cross in its beak and the Moon and Sun on the right and, respectively, the left side of its head; around the coat of arms there are letters that abbreviate the title of the lord: &ldquo;I, \u0218erban Cantacuzino Basarab Voivod, Lord and Ruler of Wallachia&rdquo;. According to Greceanu, this coat of arms indicates the legitimacy of \u0218erban as one destined to rule over the people, the Byzantine ancestry of his family, and the connection between the human and the divine.<br />\r\nAs an introduction, the editors placed a letter by \u0218erban Cantacuzino addressed to &ldquo;all that are under our dominion,&rdquo; in which he explains his decision to commission the <em>Bible</em> in the Romanian language. Because \u0218erban died and was unable to see his project completed, the patronage was continued by his nephew Constantin Br&acirc;ncoveanu, which also explains the inclusion of his name on the title page. After \u0218erban&rsquo;s letter, the editors included a laudative letter to Constantine Br&acirc;ncoveanu by the Patriarch of Jerusalem Dositheos II (1641&ndash;1707), in which he praises the lord&rsquo;s support for the Church. It follows a table of contents that divides the biblical books into three categories: the Old Testament, Apocryphal books, and the New Testament.<br />\r\nA particularity of this edition of the <em>Bible</em> is that the editors decided to include, after the books of the Maccabees, a philosophical text by Pseudo-Josephus originally entitled the <em>Supremacy of Reason</em>, translated into Romanian by the erudite Nicolae Milescu Sp\u0103tarul (1636&ndash;1708), whose works were influential in the production of the <em>Bible</em>. The epilogue is authored by Mitrofan (d. 1702), the Bishop of Hu\u0219i and later of Buz\u0103u, who was the lead typographer. In this concluding text, he provides information about the dating of the editorial process and the sources used in rendering the biblical texts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nWhereas several scholars have compared the <em>Bible</em> with Luther&rsquo;s <em>Bible</em> for the cultural impact it had on the old Romanian literature and religious history, others, like N. Cartojan, have praised it for being &ldquo;a synthesis of all endeavors undertaken by Romanian erudite in some of the most challenged times for over three centuries in all the Danubian Principalities to dress the words of God in the robe of national language.&rdquo; But regardless of these comparisons or nationalist views, it is clear from the large number of copies preserved in the repositories of public and private libraries, and in monasteries and other ecclesiastical centers, that the <em>Bible</em> circulated widely in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe from the 17th century onward.<br />\r\nAs it is specified on the title page, the <em>Bible</em> was the result of princely patronage. After financing the printing of the <em>Bible</em> into Greek in Venice in 1687, \u0218erban Cantacuzino decided to embark on a large editorial project to print the <em>Bible</em> in Romanian. But because of his death, he was unable to see it fully completed. The task was continued by Constantin Br&acirc;ncoveanu. A team of translators, editors, typographers and correctors was assembled by the lord, which makes the <em>Bible</em> the result of a collective effort. Whereas some of the people involved are mentioned between the pages of the <em>Bible</em>, the participation of others is a matter of debate. The epilogue mentions Mitrofan of Hu\u0219i as typographer, but it was suggested that Chiriac, a Moldavian typographer involved previously in the printing of the <em>Sluzebnik</em> (<em>Leitourgikon</em>) of 1680 and the Gospels of 1682, might have also participated in the printing process. Further, Germanos of Nyssa, the director of the Greek Patriarchal Academy of Constantinople, and the Stolnik Constantin Cantacuzino (1639&ndash;1716), the brother of lord \u0218erban and one of the most prominent Romanian humanists, might have been themselves consulted at specific moments of the translation process.<br />\r\nFurthermore, the full authorship of the translation has been debated too. Although priority was given to the Greceanu brothers, \u0218erban and Radu, who were considered the lead translators at the time, the matter was later settled with the discovery of the manuscript MS 45 from the Library of the Romanian Academy (the Cluj branch), a direct copy of a manuscript containing the complete translation of the Old Testament into Romanian by Nicolae Milescu. This particular translation was included, with minor modifications for printing (probably by the Greceanu brothers), into the <em>Bible</em>. The MS 45 was copied by Dumitru of C&acirc;mpulung-Muscel at the request of Theodosie, the Metropolitan of Wallachia, under whose tenure the <em>Bible</em> was printed. The epilogue by Mitrofan mentions the <em>Bible</em> printed in Frankfurt (1597) as a source for the <em>Bible</em>, and this was also the edition Milescu used for his own translation, which stands as a solid proof of his participation into the translation process. If for the Old Testament the Romanian erudite turned toward Milescu&rsquo;s translation, for the books of the New Testament, along with the brief introductions to the Gospels of Mark, Luke, and John, they used the <em>New Testament </em>printed in B\u0103lgrad (Alba Iulia in Transylvania)&nbsp;in 1648. This is another reason why the <em>Bible</em> was considered a magnificent project that involved all the Romanian-speaking regions: Wallachia, Moldavia and Translylvania.<br />\r\nRegarding its language, the <em>Bible</em> was praised for its contribution to the replacement of Slavonic with Romanian into the Church service, due to the low number of Slavonisms included in the text, which is also indicative for their decision to simplify the language to make it more appealing for the audiences. Some scholars argued against the idea of the <em>Bible</em>&rsquo;s decisive contribution to the introduction of the Wallachian &ldquo;tongue&rdquo; as basis of the literary language, and stated that the linguistic features of the <em>Bible</em> are in fact contrary to the traditional norms employed into the Wallachian contemporary oeuvres and they move away from the specifics of the literary Romanian language. However, it is clear that besides Wallachian linguistic characteristics, the language of the <em>Bible</em> includes Moldavian ones too, most probably, due to Mitrofan&rsquo;s involvement. Regardless of any shortcomings, the <em>Bible of Bucharest</em> remains a monumental work that occupies a distinctive place in Romanian literary culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\n<em>Biblia, adec\u0103 Dumnezeiasca Scriptur\u0103 ale cei vechi \u015fi ale cei noao leage toate care sau t\u0103lm\u0103cit\u016d dupre limba elineasc\u0103 spre &icirc;n\u0163elegerea limbii rom&acirc;ne\u0219ti cu porunca Prea bunului cre\u015ftin\u016d \u015fi luminatului domn\u016d Ioan\u016d \u0218\u0103rban\u016d, Catacozino Basarab\u016d Voevod\u016d \u0219</em><em>i cu &icirc;ndemnarea dumnealui Costandin\u016d Br&acirc;ncoveanul\u016d Marele Logof\u0103t\u016d [...] Tip\u0103ritusau &icirc;nt&acirc;iu &icirc;n scaunul\u016d Mitropoliei Bucure\u0219tilor\u016d, &icirc;n vreamia p\u0103storiei Prea sf[i]n\u0163utului p\u0103rinte chir\u016d Theodosie [...] la anul\u016d dela facerea lumii, 7197 iar\u0103 dela Sp\u0103seniia lumii, 1688 &icirc;n luna lui noemvri &icirc;n 10, zile</em>&nbsp;[The Bible, that is the Divine Scripture of the Old and New Testaments.

    "text":"<p><em>By Octavian-Adrian Negoi\u021b\u0103 |&nbsp;Institute for the History of Religions, Romanian Academy</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe All-Saints Monastery in Bucharest, or St. Antim Monastery as it is also known because of its founder (<em>ktetor</em>), is one of the most renowned monastic centers in Romania. The decision to establish a monastery came from Metropolitan Antim of Iviria (1650&ndash;1716; also known as Antim of Iberia), following a dream about founding a new monastery he had on February 5, 1713, on the feast day of St. Agatha. The building process began on April 24, 1713, on the site of an old wooden church dedicated to St. Nicholas of Myra, where the Holy Myrrh was kept at the time. Whereas it is believed that Antim himself designed the construction project, it is certain that he wrote a <em>Typikon</em> (<em>A\u0219ez\u0103m&acirc;ntul</em>, 32 chapters) in which he establishes a series of rules for the monastery and monastic conduct. The entire establishment was consecrated in 1715 in the presence of the ruler of Wallachia \u0218tefan Cantacuzino (r. 1714&ndash;16), and it was dedicated to the feast of All Saints, celebrated on the first Sunday after Pentecost.<br />\r\nThe monastery was built in the so-called Br&acirc;ncovanian style, having the church situated in the middle of a square courtyard, surrounded by buildings and a bell tower l positioned on the axis of the church, under which is located the main entrance into the monastery. The church follows a triconch plan with a conventional division (altar, naos, and pronaos) and was built of brick and stone. Whereas the naos is separated from the pronaos by a wall supported by four columns, it is marked off from the altar by a stone iconostasis with wooden doors. The steeple-like dome of the naos is supported by four arches. The naos has a wooden pulpit (north side) and a casket containing parts of the relics of the 40 martyrs of Sebaste (south side). The pronaos also has a dome supported by four arches, and on its western wall there is a wooden balcony with spiral stairs. The wide opened porch has ten columns that highlight the main entrance of the church, whose wooden sculpted doors are embellished with floral motifs (probably sculpted by Antim himself), being framed by a tall stone sculpted front that bears a Greek inscription under which there is sculpted a snail, Antim&rsquo;s coat of arms and a symbol of faith and humility. Built also of brick, the bell tower consists of an almost square base, one floor and the tower section, where the bells are kept.<br />\r\nA rosette with the zodiac was placed on the wall above the porch during the 1861&rsquo;s restorations by Johann Unghi. On the outside, the church shows the brick with sculpted stone frameworks for the windows, while a brick belt separates two unequal registers featuring simple ornamented arched niches. Much of the monastery&rsquo;s current appearance is due to the restoration processes that took place first between 1860 and 1863, under the guidance of chief architect Johann Schlatter (1808&ndash;65), then between 1945 and 1947 under the supervision of \u0218tefan Bal\u0219 (1902&ndash;94), then between 1965 and 1968, financed by Patriarch Justinian Marina (1948&ndash;77), under the supervision of Gheorghe Naumescu, and finally in 2016, in celebration of 300 years since the monastery&rsquo;s founding. The original painting of the church by Preda the painter is lost today. The current painting, produced in oil in a realistic fashion by Petre Alessandrescu during the 1860&ndash;63 restoration, and the furniture, sculpted by Carol Storck (1854&ndash;1926), date to the same period. The stone iconostasis dates to 1715 but its original icons (today lost) have been replaced by mosaics. The arches of the porch were painted by Costin Petrescu, who also painted the main domes of the church around 1950, while the walls of the porch present mosaics by Olga Greceanu (1890&ndash;1978), who also painted the Palace of the Library of the Holy Synod, and archim. Sofian Boghiu (1912&ndash;2002).<br />\r\nThe construction of the Parekklesion, situated on the southern side of the church, began under Antim but was finished by the boyar Matei Ruset around 1760. Its entrance is from the north, having also a sculpted door with floral motifs. It follows the plan of a nave with a dome supported by four arches. The naos is separated from the altar by a wooden iconostasis.<br />\r\nBuilt between 1911 and 1912 according to the plans of architect N. C. Mih\u0103escu, the Palace of the Library of the Holy Synod is located on the northern side of the courtyard. Between 1984 and 1986, it was moved 20.35 meters toward the west by the Communists in order to accommodate their own urban plans. The buildings around the church have two small towers in the north-east and south-east corners. A second group of buildings for housing was built between 1986 and 1988 in the second courtyard of the monastery, where the Pompilian Parekklesion is also located, which entered the monastery&rsquo;s administration in 1958.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe monastery&rsquo;s importance is tied to several aspects in its history: its foundation and founder, its printing activity, as well as its continuous restorations and role in ecclesiastical affairs. The founder, Antim of Iviria, was one of the most renowned hierarchs and cultural figures of the Danubian principalities. He was of Georgian origin, born around 1650 in the Kingdom of Kartli, and received the birth name Alexios. After Antim was enslaved by the Turks and taken to Constantinople, he was freed and worked at the Ecumenical Patriarchate, where he learned Greek, Arabic, and Turkish, sculpture, painting, embroidery, and, most importantly, he became a monk and took the name Antim. After he was acknowledged by the renowned Patriarch of Jerusalem Dositheos II (1641&ndash;1707) for his erudition, Antim traveled to Ia\u0219i with the patriarch and later he settled in Wallachia at the court of Constantin Br&acirc;ncoveanu (r. 1688&ndash;1714). Under his leadership, Antim became the first bishop of R&acirc;mnic, and later metropolitan of Wallachia.<br />\r\nAntim is well-known for his printing activities in Bucharest, Snagov, and T&acirc;rgovi\u0219te. Many liturgical books emerged from these typographies, including the 1701<em> Arabic Leitourgikon</em>, the first book printed with Arabic types in the whole world. Antim&rsquo;s disputes with the Phanariot lord Nikolaos Mavrokordatos (1680&ndash;1730) over the succession in Wallachia led to a series of misfortunes that ended with his execution by the Ottomans in 1716. He was canonized by the Romanian Patriarchate (1992), and his feast day is September 27.<br />\r\nBecause of the political plots of lord Nikolaos Mavrokordatos, Antim did not see his monastery completed. He was removed from office in 1716 and was exiled for the rest of his days to the St. Catherine Monastery, but he ended up being executed by the Turks on the road to Sinai. Because of the precarious state of the buildings left unattended by the untimely death of monastery&rsquo;s founder, Metropolitan Dositei Filitti (1734&ndash;1826) addressed Lord Alexandru Ipsilanti (1726&ndash;1807) on November 1, 1796, to assign the monastery as a metochion of the Bishopric of Arge\u0219. The aim was to open a seminary in its premises to renovate the buildings. Although the approval came on March 22, 1797, the seminary began its existence later on under Bishop Ilarion Georgiadis of Arge\u0219 (1777&ndash;1845) on February 2, 1836. He is also considered a great benefactor of the monastery, being buried on the monastic premises near the main church. Ilarion was the adviser of Tudor Vladimirescu (1780&ndash;1821), which links the monastery&rsquo;s history with the Revolution of 1821. The banner of the Revolution showing the scene of the Trinity with St. Theodore Tiron on the right and St. George on the left, was painted by monk David of the monastery. Other events also highlight the monastery&rsquo;s importance for Romanian history. From 1840, in the monastery&rsquo;s buildings functioned the State Archives, and during World War I in 1917, the monastery&rsquo;s church hosted the relics of St. Filotea of Arge\u0219, one of the most venerated local saints.<br />\r\nThe monastery&rsquo;s old parekklesion, dedicated to Sts Athanasius the Great, Charalambos, and Bessarion of Larissa, was also restored in modern times. In 1860, the renowned Romanian painter Gheorghe T\u0103t\u0103r\u0103scu (1886&ndash;1957) painted the iconostasis. Because of the precarious state of the frescos, they were repainted under Patriarch Justinian in 1951 by painter Dimitrie Dumitriu Nicolaide and Archim. Sofian Boghiu. The fresco of the Dormition of the Virgin, painted on the western wall of the parekklesion is of particular importance. Around the main scene, members of the Burning Bush group were painted on both sides. The Burning Bush was a cultural movement that began in 1945 at Antim Monastery under Alexandru &ldquo;Agaton&rdquo; Teodorescu (&ldquo;Daniil&rdquo; Sandu Tudor, 1896-1962). The focus of the movement was the hesychast prayer, but after 1948, when the Communist party declared it a &ldquo;subversive organization,&rdquo; it became a group where renowned monks and laymen gathered to uphold Orthodox values and faith against Communist atheism. In this regard, the monastery became the center of the gatherings where members of the group (e.g., Sofian Boghiu, Paul Constantinescu, Adrian F\u0103ge\u021beanu, Olga Greceanu, Andrei Scrima, Paul Sterian, Vasile Voiculescu) engaged in intellectual, theological, and literary activities. A museum of the movement exists today on the first floor of the tower bell.<br />\r\nAfter its foundation, there was also printing activity at the monastery, as the <em>Judaic History</em> of Alexander Mavrokordatos (1636&ndash;1709) was printed here in 1716, along with Nicholas Mavrokordatos&rsquo; <em>About duties</em> few years later in 1719, and an <em>Octoechos</em> in 1720. Recently, the monastery&rsquo;s museum was reopened for the public. It hosts sacred objects and rare books from the special collections of the Romanian Patriarchate. Moreover, a second museum was opened recently for the public. Located on the first floor of the bell tower, the Museum of the Burning Bush hosts items related to the intellectual and spiritual activities of the members of this renowned cultural movement. Finally, the collections of manuscripts, documents, and rare books hosted in the Library of the Holy Synod of the Romanian Patriarchate are of particular importance not only for the monastery, but for the entire religious and cultural history of the Romanian Church and Eastern Europe.<br />\r\nThe monastery plays an important role in the ecclesiastical affairs of the Romanian Patriarchate as the Holy Myrrh&nbsp;(necessary for anointing, the consecration of churches and, in the past, for anointing rulers) is prepared, whenever necessary, in the second parekklesion of the monastery, called Pompilian Parekklesion. Still, the monastery remains a place of worship and pilgrimage. With a growth in the number of monks, the monastery organizes liturgical services and cultural activities, which makes it one of the most renowned and well-known landmarks of the city of Bucharest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nBoghiu, S.

    "text":"<p><em>By Octavian-Adrian Negoi\u021b\u0103 | Institute for the History of Religions, Romanian Academy</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe so-called <em>Slavonic Leitourgikon</em> (<em>Sluzebnik</em>) of Macarie the Hieromonk, created sometime at the turn of the 16th century, is a liturgical book intended for the divine liturgical service of the Eastern Church, whose core texts are the liturgies of John Chrysostom, Basil the Great, and Gregory the Dialogist. Published on November 10, 1508, in the Slavonic language of the middle-Bulgarian redaction, the <em>Leitourgikon</em> is the product of the printing house established at Dealu Monastery in T&acirc;rgovi\u0219te by prince Radu the Great (r. 1495&ndash;1508). It comprises liturgical texts along its 256 pages (128 sheets, the first four unnumbered) that are numbered according to 16 fascicles. The first 15 fascicles contain 8 sheets (16 pages) and are numbered in Cyrillic numerals, while the last one has only 4 unnumbered sheets (8 pages). The dimensions of the book are 220 x 150 mm.<br />\r\nThe ornaments of the <em>Leitourgikon</em> features six frontispieces in three variants, along with many other ornamented initial letters. The frontispieces mainly take the form of interlaced braids with two crowns on the upper sides (variant 1), braids that form two interlaced circles with two crowns positioned on the upper sides (variant 2), and a square of interlaced braids bearing in the middle the Wallachian coat of arms, the eagle with a cross in its peak. The initial letters are also formed of interlaced braids with floral and herbal motifs imitating the Glagolitic uncial script. The origins of these ornaments have been disputed, with some scholars arguing in favor of Venetian origins, while others considering Moldavian roots as the ornaments resemble those of the Moldavian manuscripts from the time of Stephen the Great (r. 1457&ndash;1504). The identity of the miniaturist is also unknown, although the hypothesis of Macarie himself has been put forward.<br />\r\nThe text generally stretches throughout 15 lines on the page, and is printed in black and red ink. The red ink was reserved for some of the first frontispieces, titles, initial letters, and some of the liturgical indications for the clergy. Moreover, the paper presents six types of filigranes: the Libra in a circle with two variants (with triangular plates and with round plates), the anchor in a circle (and without the circle), the cardinal&rsquo;s hat, and the isolated star.<br />\r\nThe book does not have a title page. The epilogue placed at the end of the book (fols. 255&ndash;56) provides the reader with information about the patron, the typographer, and the date of production. The unnumbered pages at the beginning of the book contain the <em>Teaching by Basil the Great towards the priest about the divine service and about the Eucharist</em> (fols. 1&ndash;5), and the <em>Table of contents</em> (fols. 6&ndash;8), which includes also the title of Basil&rsquo;s teaching presented before. Then the disposition of the contents throughout the book is as follows: 1. <em>The Order of the Divine Service that Includes the Service of the Deacon</em> (fols. 9&ndash;23); 2. <em>The Liturgy of John Chrysostom</em> (fols. 24&ndash;112), which is omitted in the Table of contents; the text of the Liturgy begins in fact on page 31, while on page 24 there is the text of the Proscomedia and between pages 29&ndash;31 there is the <em>Service of Preparation of the Clergy for the Liturgy</em>; 3. T<em>he Liturgy of Basil the Great </em>(fols. 113&ndash;72); 4. <em>The Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts of St. Gregory the Dialogist</em> (fols. 173&ndash;212); 5. <em>The Prayers the Deacon Recites during the Great Vesper at Litia</em> (fols. 213&ndash;25); 6. <em>The Service of the Vespers</em> (fols. 225&ndash;9); 7. <em>The Service of the Matins</em> (fols. 229&ndash;34); 8. <em>The Endings of the Services</em> (fols. 234&ndash;43), 9. <em>The Prayer Recited by the Bishop or Confessor for the Forgiveness of All Sins, Intentional or Unintentional, All the Curses and Anathemas and Every Other Sin</em> (fols. 244&ndash;52); 10. <em>The Second Prayer for the Same Things </em>(fols. 252&ndash;3); 11. <em>Cherubic Hymn for the Great Saturday</em> (fols. 253&ndash;4); 12. <em>Cherubic Hymns for the Regular Liturgical Week</em> (fols. 254&ndash;5), for which the Table of contents mentions that they are for the Liturgy of John; and 13. <em>The Epilogue</em>, which does not appear in the Table of contents.<br />\r\nThere are only 12 copies of Macarie&rsquo;s <em>Leitourgikon</em> preserved today: five in Romania and seven in international collections. The Library of the Romanian Academy holds three copies (two belonged to Bistri\u021ba Monastery of Oltenia and one to the Church of Alba Iulia), the Romanian National Library in Bucharest holds one, and the Library of the Archbishopric of Sibiu has one copy, too. In international libraries there are five copies preserved in Russian collections (two at the State Historical Museum and the State Library of Moscow), one in Budapest at Sz&eacute;chenyi Library, one in the Library of Hilandar Monastery of Mount Athos, and another at the Serbian National Library in Belgrade.<br />\r\nThe original binding of the book is not preserved on any of the remaining copies of the <em>Leitourgikon</em>. One of the copies that originates from Bistri\u021ba (sixteenth century) and is now preserved at the Library of the Romanian Academy has a wooden binding covered in brown leather with remnants of iron locks. On the front, the cover bears a rectangle with two large frames, the first beginning with a repetitive ornamental pattern, and the second placed in the interior of the first, bearing a design of undulating lines and interrupted by dots. In the interior of the frames there are three double diagonal lines cut by a rhombus inscribed in the rectangle formed in the middle by the frames. At the junction points between the lines and the rhombus and also of the meeting point between the rhombus and the diagonals with the two frames there are small circles around which the binder placed flowers and small rhombuses with leaves inside. All the other copies of the <em>Leitourgikon</em> have either modern or local bindings dating from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe <em>Slavonic Leitourgikon</em> of Macarie is the first book ever printed in the Danubian principalities and the first printed edition of a <em>Slavonic Leitourgikon</em>. According to the medieval sources, Macarie never entitled his edition a <em>Leitourgikon </em>or a <em>Sluzebnik</em>, but he simply called it <em>Liturgy.</em> It has been argued that its publication in Wallachia is connected with the spiritual rebirth that took place in the beginning of the 16th century under the leadership of Radu the Great and Neagoe Basarab (r. 1512&ndash;21). Moreover, the<em> Leitourgikon</em>&rsquo;s publication was intended to respond to the liturgical needs of the Church in Wallachia, and also to strengthen the political authority of the rulers. The Slavonic language was used in Wallachia at the court and in the Church, and this book become thus the basis of the liturgical service.<br />\r\nThe publication of this book is linked with its typographer. Macarie was a native of Montenegro, and trained in printing in Venice. The Serbian Prince of the Principality of Zeta in Montenegro, George Crnojevi\u0107 (r. 1492&ndash;6), founded a printing house in Cetinje and appointed Macarie as its head typographer. There, Macarie printed the <em>Octoechos</em> in two parts (1493&ndash;4), the <em>Psalterion</em> (1495), and the <em>Euchologion</em> (1493&ndash;5). In 1496, the activity of this typography ended because of the Turkish invasions, and Macarie and other Serbian nobles were forced to flee to Venice. Radu the Great brought some of these nobles to Wallachia, among them being Maxim Brankovi\u0107 (1461&ndash;1515), who became bishop of R&acirc;mnic-Noul Severin, and Macarie, who was appointed the head typographer of the printing press installed by the prince at Dealu Monastery in T&acirc;rgovi\u0219te. Nevertheless, there are a few hypotheses concerning the identity of Macarie. Some scholars have argued that he was a different person than Macarios of Cetinje due to the differences in types used at the printing house of Cetinje and the one at T&acirc;rgovi\u0219te, while others have proposed that he is the same person, known also as Macarios of Hilandar Monastery on Mount Athos, which is considered the most plausible hypothesis.<br />\r\nAccording to the Epilogue, the<em> Leitourgikon</em> was financed first by prince Radu the Great and then was continued by Mihnea the Evil (r. 1508&ndash;9) after Radu&rsquo;s death. Although there is a consensus now that the book was published at Dealu Monastery, the place of publication has also been a topic of debate. A Venetian milieu was considered, but also Bistri\u021ba Monastery in Oltenia, because of the multiple copies of Macarie&rsquo;s editions discovered there. Whereas the printing of the <em>Leitourgikon</em> began under Radu the Great maybe in 1506 or 1507, the Epilogue is very clear about the book&rsquo;s publication: &ldquo;year 7016 [1508], the circle of the Sun 16, of the Moon 5, indictions 11, month November, day 10.&rdquo; The Epilogue does not mention the metropolitan&rsquo;s name, as it was the custom of the printed editions. The description mentioned in the Epilogue for the prince, &ldquo;lord of the entire Ungrovlachia and Podunavia,&rdquo; was not used anymore in the 16th century. It dates to the first half of the 15th century and it is connected with prince Mircea the Old&rsquo;s (r. 1397&ndash;1418) dominion in Dobrogea and Kilia. This is indicative of the fact that Macarie researched old documents (<em>hrisov</em>) and used this title for all of his Wallachian editions. Macarie printed three editions at T&acirc;rgovi\u0219te: the <em>Leitourgikon</em>, the <em>Octoechos</em> (August 26, 1510), and the <em>Gospels </em>(<em>Tetraevanghelul</em>, June 25, 1512), all these texts share common features in structure, paper, types, and ornaments. The multitude of watermarks (filigranes) discovered on copies of the Leitourgikon led scholars to believe that the paper used for its publication is of Venetian origin and was imported into Wallachia by the merchants of Sibiu (Transylvania), who, most probably, purchased different batches of paper.<br />\r\nAlthough it looks as a deluxe edition, the <em>Leitourgikon</em> presents many linguistic mistakes, misspellings, and errors of text transcription, with careless typing, which is indicative of the incipit phase of the printing press in the region. In fact, because of these mistakes, the leaders of the clergy ordered the reprinting of the fascicle 2 of the <em>Leitourgikon</em>. The main source of Macarie&rsquo;s<em> Leitourgikon</em> is, most probably, a prototype similar to the <em>Sluzebnik</em> translated into Slavonic by Euthymius of T&acirc;rnovo (1375&ndash;93), the Patriarch of Bulgaria, in the second half of the 14th century, which closely followed the <em>Diataxis </em>of Patriarch Philotheos I of Constantinople (c. 1300&ndash;79). It has been argued that the prototype was either authored by Maxim Brankovi\u0107 (Serbian origin), Nicodim of Tismana (1320&ndash;1406) or, most probably, by Niphon II of Constantinople (d. 1508), which indicates a Wallachian origin. Due to the fact that the language used is Slavonic of a middle-Bulgarian recension, which is different from the Slavonic of Macarie&rsquo;s milieu in Cetinje, scholars have argued that Macarie might have used a local manuscript for his <em>Leitourgikon</em>. <em>The Teaching by Basil the Great towards the Priest</em>, which opens the <em>Leitourgikon</em>, is unnumbered. This observation has led scholars to believe that the text did not exist in the original manuscript used by Macarie. Moreover, the mentioning of the two Serbian saints, Sava and Simion, in the prayers of the Liturgy is a remnant from Macarie&rsquo;s cultural and religious milieu. The format of the liturgical texts of the <em>Leitourgikon</em> do not present major textual differences from their modern counterparts. There are only word omissions and, in some cases, entire prayers are absent (e.g., the prayer for the epigonation, a liturgical vestment for the priest, is absent from the <em>Leitourgikon</em>) but these do not affect in a major way the liturgical ritual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\n<em>Liturghier</em>.

Its foundation was sponsored by the Moldavian prince Stephen the Great (r. 1457&ndash;1504), who ordered its construction in celebration of his victory over the Ottoman Turks at Valea Alb\u0103 in 1476. The monastery was built in 1488 during a relatively short period between May 26 and September 14, on the site of an older wooden church. The new church was dedicated to St. George. The katholikon (main church) is situated at the center of the monastic courtyard, which is surrounded by tall walls of stone, as well as other buildings such as the refectory, cells, and rooms used for various monastic activities. On the southeastern side of the courtyard there is a bell tower built of stone with the bells offered by the patron at the monastery&rsquo;s dedication.<br />\r\nThe entire architecture is representative of the so-called &ldquo;Moldavian style&rdquo;, which developed through local adaptations of building and decorating traditions characteristic of Byzantine, Slavic, and western Gothic models. The katholikon presents a triconch plan with apses at the altar and in the northern and southern sides of the naos. Moreover, it follows the usual division of the space into altar, naos, and pronaos. The katholikon received a closed porch in 1547 during the reign of lord Peter Rare\u0219 (r. I: 1527&ndash;38; II. 1541&ndash;46), the son of Stephen the Great. An iconostasis of sculpted yew tree separates the naos from the altar, while the naos is separated from the pronaos by a tall wall that has an arched entrance in the middle. The naos has a narrow dome supported by four large arches at the base and four other smaller arches placed above the large ones. The pronaos has four arches that support a closed dome. The pronaos is also separated by the closed porch by a wall. The porch has an arched ceiling that stretches from its northern to southern side. Above the entrance from the porch to the pronaos there is an inscription in Slavonic about the foundation of the monastery. The closed porch features on each side (north and south) entrances above which there are large windows with Gothic tracery.<br />\r\nThe Moldavian architectural style of the monastery is visible through the exterior niches under the cornice, the arches in the apse, and the glazed disks embedded in the upper portion of the exterior. The facades also include decorations, rows of ceramic enameled discs in relief of heraldic motifs (rampant lion, the aurochs&rsquo; head of the Moldavian coat of arms, and even creatures of Western European medieval literature, such as the two tailed mermaids), while the vaulting designs of the pronaos and naos domes feature also a &ldquo;local&rdquo; character.<br />\r\nMoreover, the church also presents elements of late Gothic style: its tall walls, the massive buttresses on the exterior walls, the frames of the doors, and the frames of the windows placed above the main entrances displaying a broken arch, but also the style of the sculpted stone derive from Gothic models. Apart from the closed exonarthex, the church has small windows of rectangular frames, as well as the southern and northern doors of the pronaos. The church&rsquo;s roof follows a traditional Moldavian model with wide eaves and built of small wooden tiles, used also in the building of local houses.<br />\r\nBesides its complex architectural style, Vorone\u021b Monastery is known mostly for its superb frescoes painted on the inner and outer walls of the church. The frescoes inside the church follow to a great degree the norms of the Byzantine church painting for all the four divisions (altar, naos, pronaos and exonarthex), but with features specific to the churches built by Stephen the Great (e.g., the interior presents many Christological and Mariological scenes). Moreover, in the naos there is the votive fresco (1496) of Stephen and his Lady Maria-Voichi\u021ba, along with their son the prince of Moldavia Bogdan III the Blind (r. 1504&ndash;17). On the ceiling of the pronaos is represented the Virgin Mary with the Christ Child surrounded by angels. The closed porch received the Christian calendar that consists of saints and scenes from their lives arranged from September to August.<br />\r\nUnfortunately, because of weather damage, most of the frescoes painted outside on the northern walls and outside the naos&rsquo; dome are badly damaged or lost today. The western wall displays a complex fresco of the Last Judgment that brings together multiple themes and figures. In part, the particular &ldquo;blue of Vorone\u021b&rdquo; has also drawn parallels with the Sistine Chapel frescoes. The other facades of the porch display themes from the life of Sts Nicholas and John the New of Suceava, while on the buttresses St. George Killing the Dragon and the Tolls of Heavens are painted. On the facades of the pronaos and naos the iconography follows the traditional hermeneutical indications: the walls of the lateral apses and the altar received the scene of the Heavenly and Earthly Hierarchy (i.e., the procession of all saints from the Old and New Testaments heading towards the East). On the southern facade of the pronaos there is the Tree of Jesse with frescoes of the Ancient Greek and Latin philosophers, also known as the Genealogical Tree of Jesus Christ. The third theme painted is the Akathist Hymn (partly lost today), which is placed on the northern facade of the church. On the left side of the church entrance are rendered the silhouettes of St Daniel the Hermit (d. 1496), a renowned spiritual figure in Moldavia, and Metropolitan Gregory Ro\u0219ca (1480&ndash;1570), who are also considered the founders (ktetors) of the monastery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe Moldavian chronicler Ion Neculce (1672&ndash;1745) included in his chronicle the story of the foundation of Voronet Monastery. It mentions Stephen visiting Daniel the Hermit at Vorone\u021b during his travels to northern Moldavia from Neam\u021b. Stephen confessed to the great hermit telling him that he is concerned about his Turkish wars that he does not see a victory ahead. Daniel comforted the lord and told him that he will win the wars only if he builds a monastery at Vorone\u021b. Regardless of the legend that surrounds the beginnings of Vorone\u021b Monastery, it is certain that both Stephen the Great and Daniel the Hermit played a crucial part in the monastery&rsquo;s foundation. The beginnings of the monastery are also connected, through Daniel&rsquo;s activities, to the hesychast movement that took place in Moldavia at the end of the 15th century. Daniel himself is buried in the pronaos of the monastery.<br />\r\nAn important turn in the monastery&rsquo;s history is the year 1547 when Metropolitan Gregory Ro\u0219ca enlarged the church, added the closed exonarthex, and, more importantly, embellished the facades with frescoes (the frescoes from the interior of the porch date also from this period; whereas those of the naos and altar from Stephen&rsquo;s times). Scholars argued that the frescoes of the facades belong in fact to the age of lord Peter Rare\u0219, and are connected thus with the churches of Probota, Humor, Moldovi\u021ba and Arbore, which follow in that tradition but date to later. For his activity at the monastery, Metropolitan Ro\u0219ca is the third founder (<em>ktetor</em>) of Vorone\u021b. The beautiful shade of blue of the exterior frescoes, obtained by the painters by adding in the composition of the paint a mineral called azurite, made scholars consider this as important as the red of the Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens (1577&ndash;1640) or the green of the Renaissance painter Paolo Veronese (1528&ndash;88).<br />\r\nThe meaning of the exterior paintings has its own story. In the scene of the Last Judgment, which describes a classical eschatological scenario with Christ judging over the entire world, the Turks that are placed among the foreign people will be convicted by Christ. The Turks were the enemies of the state and therefore the fresco encapsulates also a political meaning. Similarly, the 12 frescoes representing the martyrdom of John the New and the transition of his relics to Suceava was of particular importance for Metropolitan Ro\u0219ca, who decided on their painting on the south facade, near the entrance. St John was martyred by the Tatars, and the frescoes have thus both a political and a religious perspective. The frescoes with scenes from the lives of Sts Nicholas and Anthony, the founder of Eastern monasticism, to which can be added the fresco of the Tolls of Heavens, are characteristic for the monastic milieu. Nevertheless, all the frescoes speak of the autochthonous life in Moldavia: Adam and Eve are represented engaged in the works of Moldavian peasants, as Eve purrs wool and Adam is driving a cart with bulls; the angels from the Last Judgment scene are blowing in <em>buciums </em>(Moldavian horns), while the householders from the Parable of the Prodigal Son are bound together in a traditional Moldavian dance (hora); other figures are represented as Moldavian nobles or as simple peasants, as representative for the cultural life of Vorone\u021b.<br />\r\nFrom its foundation until 1785, Vorone\u021b functioned as a monastery of monks. During this period, the monastery experienced a flourishing phase as local leaders and nobles gifted the monastery with estates, monetary donations, books, and other liturgical objects. In 1785, after the Habsburg conquest of the northern part of Moldavia, the monastery became one of the 23 monasteries whose monastic life was abolished by the new rulers. It functioned only as a parish church, while most of its possessions were transferred to other monasteries from the region (Dragomirna, Sucevi\u021ba, Putna). The monks had to leave the establishment, while the monastic buildings slowly turned into ruins. After 1918, the state turned toward Vorone\u021b and declared it a historical monument. Under the Communist regime, the religious importance of the monastery was ignored, and it was recognized only as a historical and artistic monument, as the liturgical service and monastic activities were forbidden. Nevertheless, in 1991, after the fall of Communism, the Holy Synod of the Romanian Church reopened Vorone\u021b and decided to turn it into a nunnery; it functions as such until today. Since 1993, the monastery has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.<br />\r\nVorone\u021b Monastery still plays an important role in the monastic life of Eastern Europe. Its name is bound to the many works of art preserved either at the monastery or in other collections. The funerary stones of the tombs placed in the pronaos, the sculpted furniture inside the church, embroideries, the precious liturgical objects, and the frescoes make Vorone\u021b one of the most significant monastic establishments and an important center of culture in the region. Lastly, the oldest Romanian manuscripts &ndash; the <em>Codex of Vorone\u021b </em>and the<em> Psalterion of Vorone\u021b</em>, both produced in the 16th century at the monastery&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;are indicative for the monastery&rsquo;s literary activity in Moldavia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nCincheza-Buculei, E. &ldquo;Le programme iconographique du narthex de l`&eacute;glise du monast&egrave;re de Vorone\u021b.&rdquo; <em>Revue Roumaine d&rsquo;Histoire de l&rsquo;Art &ndash; S&eacute;rie Beaux-Arts</em> 30 (1993): 3&ndash;23.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This study offers a discussion over the iconographic program of the monastery&rsquo;s narthex and points to its specificities during the Steven the Great&rsquo;s era.</p><p>Ciobanu, C.

    "text":"<p><em>By Octavian-Adrian Negoi\u021b\u0103 | Institute for the History of Religions, Romanian Academy</em><br />\r\n<strong>Overview</strong><br />\r\nThe antimension is a liturgical object, a piece of cloth of rectangular form, made of either silk or linen. It is of crucial importance for the celebration of the Divine Liturgy, and its etymology too points to its liturgical usage: a combination between the Greek preposition <em>anti-</em> (\u1f00&nu;&tau;\u1f77; &ldquo;instead of&rdquo;) and the Latin word <em>mensa </em>(&ldquo;table&rdquo;), which has led scholars to consider it as a moveable altar and a holy table in miniature. Preserved in the sanctuary on the holy table, the antimension is kept folded into a silk cloth called <em>eileton</em> (&tau;\u1f78 &epsilon;\u1f30&lambda;&eta;&tau;\u1f78&nu;; &ldquo;cover&rdquo;), whose purpose today is to protect the antimension. On its back side, the antimension has a small pocket in which there are sewn relics of martyrs, which are covered in wax and anointed with the Holy and Great Myrrh. During the celebration of the Liturgy, the priest removes the antimension from the <em>eileton</em> and unfolds it onto the altar table, placing upon it the Chalice and Diskarion to collect any small pieces of the Eucharist that might fall, which he would gather by brushing the antimension with a small sponge. The consecration of the new antimensia is performed by the bishop before the beginning of the Liturgy by anointing them with the Holy and Great Myrrh. After this, the Liturgy is celebrated seven consecutive days upon the new antimensia.<br />\r\nThe iconography of the antimension features the scene of the<em> Lament of Christ upon the Tomb</em> (<em>Epitaphios thr\u0113nos</em>, \u1f18&pi;&iota;&tau;\u03ac&phi;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf; &theta;&rho;\u1fc6&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;) by the Virgin, John the Evangelist, Mary Magdalene, Joseph of Arimathea, and Nikodemos, in the presence of angels with a display of the instruments of the Passion (e.g., the cross, the crown of thorns, the spear, the sponge placed upon a reed, etc.), the busts of the four evangelists placed on each of the four corners of the antimension, and lastly an inscription.<br />\r\nThe antimension has both theological and ecclesiastical significance. It symbolizes the shrouds that covered Christ&rsquo;s body in the tomb (and also the tomb itself), and the sacramental link between the bishop, whose signature is placed upon the antimension under the inscription, and the priest of a certain church placed under the bishop&rsquo;s jurisdiction. A church is bestowed with a new antimension every time a new bishop is enthroned in the eparchy or after the church&rsquo;s foundation during the sanctification ritual. It also contains in the inscription the name of the church and the patron saint (or feast) to whom the church is dedicated. All of these details point to the importance of the antimension not only for its liturgical usage, but also for the history of the Church.<br />\r\nThe sources indicate that the antimension was made either of wood or linen. Even if there are copies of wooden antimensia preserved today (e.g., the antimension of Patriarch Joachim IV of Antioch, Church of Hagia Paraskevi [1572], or the antimension of Nikephoros of Cyprus, Kykkos Monastery [1653]), the largest number of them are produced of either linen or silk. The dimensions differed across time but, along with the printing phase, the antimension became more standardized (cca. 600 mm x 500 mm). The iconography itself experienced many phases of development. Whereas until the fifteenth century, a cross (in either Greek or Slavonic style) erected on an artistic representation of Golgotha with Christ&rsquo;s monogram would dominate the central scene (on some occasions having on display some of the objects of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings), the busts or the initials of the four evangelists would be placed in the corners only during the sixteenth- and seventeenth centuries. Moreover, the scene of Christ vertically sitting in his tomb or a chalice is encountered especially during the 17th century. Along with the development of printing activities during the 17th and 18th centuries, the antimensia began to be printed and not drawn in ink anymore, which provided a good opportunity to expand even more their iconography. The scene of the<em> Lament of Christ upon the Tomb</em> begins to occupy the central part of the antimension at this later stage, and other elaborate artistic features appear around it. These details point to the artistic importance of antimensia and their development over time.<br />\r\nConcerning antimensia in the Danubian principalities, these liturgical objects are of paramount importance for the cultural and religious history of the region. Although there were antimensia that were produced and circulated there at least from the 15th century onward, the oldest copies preserved today date to the 17th century. Whereas the copies of Greek origin that circulated in the Danubian territories are few, the Slavonic ones (or Romanian in Cyrillic script) were produced in great numbers starting in the 17th century. The oldest antimension from Wallachia is the one of Metropolitan Luke (1602&ndash;29). Unfortunately, there is no information today about its whereabouts, but it belonged to the Br\u0103detu Skete of Arge\u0219. The Romanian historian Nicolae Iorga was able to analyze it almost 90 years ago and provided a description. It was not printed but drawn with ink. It featured a cross of twisted stalks placed in the middle, surrounded on each side by the Greek initials of the monogram: IC XC NI KA. In the lower part of the cross, on both sides of its basis, the Slavonic letters M &Lambda; P \u0411 that mean &ldquo;the Place of the Skull [Golgotha] became Heaven&rdquo; [\u043c\u044b\u0432\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043b\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0454 \u0440\u0430\u0439 \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u044c] appear. In the lower part there are the initials \u0490 \u0410 that stand for &ldquo;the Skull of Adam&rdquo; (\u0490\u043b\u0430\u0431\u0430 A\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0430), and a rudimentary drawing of it. In each of the corners there are the initials of the four evangelists. The Slavonic inscription placed on the antimension reads: &ldquo;This antimension was consecrated by the most holy father Metropolitan Luke of the entire Wallachia in the days of the most benevolent voivod Radu [\u0218erban, r. I: 1601; II: 1602&ndash;10], in the year 7112 [1604].&rdquo;<br />\r\nThe oldest antimension printed on linen is of Wallachian origin. Preserved at the Museum of the Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Patriarchate, the antimension dates to the second half of the 17th century (January 21, 1650) and belongs to the Metropolitan of Wallachia Stephen I (1648&ndash;53; 1655&ndash;68), renowned for his typographical activity in T&acirc;rgovi\u0219te. The iconography is of particular importance. In the center there is the body of Christ carried by two angels and placed in a chalice situated at the base of the cross erected behind him. The cross has on top the abbreviation I N \u0426 I (&ldquo;Jesus the Nazarene, king of Jews&rdquo;). The objects of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings are present nearby: the spear, the sponge on top of a reed, and, in the middle, the crown of thorns. Two angels give incense to Christ at the bottom of the chalice, where the skull of Adam is also printed. On the right side of Christ, there is the Virgin, while on the left, John the Evangelist. On each of the four corners of the antimension there are round medallions that feature the symbols of the four evangelists (i.e., the angel, the ox, the lion, and the eagle). The antimension has a double border adorned with floral motifs. The Slavonic inscription placed on both sides of the main scene reads: &ldquo;[This is a] divine altar for the celebration of the divine and bloodless service [i.e., the Liturgy]. It was consecrated and blessed by the hand of the most holy metropolitan kyr Steven during the reign of Lord Matthew [Basarab, 1632&ndash;54], voivod of the entire Wallachia, month January, year 7158 [1650].&rdquo;<br />\r\nAnother special antimension, also from Stephen I, dates to 1657. This antimension is preserved today in the collections of the Romanian National Museum of Art in Bucharest and it originally belonged to the church of Vl\u0103de\u0219ti (Arge\u0219). As in the case of the antimension of Metropolitan Luke, it is drawn in ink, not printed. Its iconography follows the one of Metropolitan Luke&rsquo;s antimension. It presents in the middle a cross with a base, built only of simple lines. The monogram IC XC NI KA is displayed on each side of the cross and, on its base, besides the same Slavonic initials M &Lambda; P \u0411 and \u0490 \u0410, the antimension of Stephen I has a drawing of Adam&rsquo; skull, too. In the corners, the abbreviations for the names of the four evangelists can be observed, but the Slavonic inscription is larger than that of the antimension of Metropolitan Luke. It reads: &ldquo;[This is an] Altar of our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ, on which is celebrated the holy and bloodless service [the Liturgy]. It was consecrated and blessed by the hand of the most holy Metropolitan Steven, in the days of voivod Constantine [\u0218erban, r. 1654&ndash;8], in the church dedicated [to the feast of] the Beheading of St John the Forerunner, in the village of the most noble P&acirc;rvu vel vistier [treasurer], called Vl\u0103de\u0219ti, November 8, 7165 [1657].&rdquo;<br />\r\nAn example of an antimension produced in Wallachia with a more complex iconography than the previous ones discussed already is the antimension of Metropolitan Antim of Iviria (1650&ndash;1716), whose dating was placed after 1708. Scholars have shown that this antimension follows as a model an antimension of Metropolitan Theodosios of Wallachia, which was itself prepared for printing by Antim. Regarding its iconography, the central image of the antimension is the Lament of Christ upon the Tomb, having Christ shrouded in a cloth, surrounded by five figures: the Virgin Mary, John the Evangelist, [most probably], Mary Magdalene, Joseph of Arimathea, and Nikodemos. In the background, there is the cross that bears on top the abbreviation I N \u0426 I with some of the objects of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings. On each side of the cross, there are two angels that have in their hands a spear and a shroud. In the four corners of this scene there are the four evangelists placed in medallions of vegetal motifs with busts of winged angels above them. The entire antimension has a very ornate wide border that depicts the mandylion of Veronica, a chalice and two victory flags, on the top side, while on the lower side there is the bowl in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands, a pair of pliers, and a hammer. On the lateral sides, one can observe again some of the objects of Christ&rsquo;s sufferings. A copy of Antim&rsquo;s antimension is preserved today in the museum of the Antim Monastery in Bucharest, but there are others kept in the Art Collection of the Romanian Patriarchate and the Museum of the Archbishopric of Sibiu. Antim&rsquo;s antimension served as a model for many subsequent antimensia signed by the metropolitans of Wallachia.<br />\r\nFrom&nbsp;Moldavia, the oldest known antimension dates to 1429, known as the antimension of Metropolitan Damian of Moldavia, which is lost today. According to Nicolae Iorga, who found a note on a chronicle, the name of the metropolitan must have been inscribed on the antimension. Yet another lost old antimension, dated September 12, 1648, is the antimension of the renowned Metropolitan of Moldavia Barlaam (1590&ndash;1657). The copy investigated by scholars a few decades ago was offered to Agapia Monastery, and, from there, circulated to Secu Monastery and finally Neam\u021b Monastery. The antimension was made of silk and padded with linen and was adorned with floral motifs drawn in ink. The main scene of the antimension is the <em>Lament of Christ upon the Tomb</em>&nbsp;is surrounded by four angels holding his shroud. In the background, there is the cross (with the abbreviation I N \u0426 I on the top) with the spear and the reed with a sponge on each of its sides, while the crown of thorns hangs upon it. Moreover, on top of the cross there is Christ&rsquo;s monogram and on the four corners of the antimension the busts of the four evangelists in round medallions of floral motifs are found. The entire antimension is surrounded by a wide border of floral motifs. Finally, in the background of the scene of the lament, on the right and left sides of the cross, there is a large inscription that reads: &ldquo;[This is a] divine and blessed altar of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. With the power of the Holy Ghost began, worked and finished this [church] dedicated to the Assembly of Archangel Michael and of the other bodiless heavenly powers, with the blessing and consecration by the hand of most holy archbishop <em>kyr</em> Barlaam, Metropolitan of Suceava. This holy work was completed in the days of the most holy lord Basil voivod with the desire and expense of the benefactor pan Gabriel, the<em> hatman</em> and <em>p&acirc;rc\u0103lab</em> [governor] of Suceava. Year 7156 [1648], month of September, 12 days.&rdquo;<br />\r\nThe antimension of the Bishop of Roman Pachomios of Gledin (1671&ndash;1724), who acted previously as the abbot of Neam\u021b Monastery, is of particular importance as its iconography follows a Russian model (1665) associated with Patriarch Nikon (1605&ndash;81). The main scene is again the <em>Lament of Christ upon the Tomb </em>having Christ surrounded by the usual five figures but with an additional one here, namely the myrrh-bearing woman Mary of Cleopas. In the background there is the cross bearing on top the abbreviation I N \u0426 I, while on both of its sides there are two angels holding liturgical fans, an object that symbolizes the Seraphims. Above the cross is placed the Father emerging from clouds, while the Holy Spirit descends on a glowing radius upon Christ&rsquo;s dead body. The four corners of the antimension display the symbols of the four evangelists in round medallions. The antimension features a rich ornamented border and some liturgical inscriptions. Pachomios offered his antimension on August 15, 1714, to the Pocrov Skete of Neam\u021b.<br />\r\nPrinted in 1753, the antimension of Jacob of Putna (1750&ndash;60) served as a model for many antimensia printed after it. The main scene printed on the antimension is the <em>Lament of Christ upon the Tomb </em>with the Virgin in the middle, having a sword piercing her chest, John the Evangelist, Mary Magdalene, Joseph of Arimathea, and Nikodemos surrounding the dead body of Christ. In the background, there is the cross that bears on top the abbreviation I N \u0426 I and some of the objects associated with Christ&rsquo;s sufferings. On the left and right sides of the cross there are two Seraphims that bear in their hands lit torches, while in the back the Sun, the Moon, and stars appear. In the upper part, the icon of the Trinity is depicted, held up by two angels. The icon is surrounded by the words: &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth; heaven and earth are full of thy glory.&rdquo; On each corner of the antimension, there are the four evangelists, each with his symbol depicted beside them. Moreover, on the left side, right between the evangelists John and Luke, there is a depiction of the Resurrection, while on the other side, between Matthew and Mark there is the scene of Christ&rsquo;s flagellation. The entire antimension is surrounded by a wide border of floral motifs that has busts of angels on its outside corners and in the middle of its upper side the Veronica&rsquo;s mandylion. Beneath the scene of the lament, there is an inscription that states: &ldquo;[This is a] divine and holy altar on which are celebrated the divine mysteries; it was blessed by most holy <em>kyriou kyr</em> Jacob, the Metropolitan of Moldavia. Year 1753, June, [...].&rdquo;<br />\r\nFrom Transylvania, Maramure\u0219, and Banat, there are copies of antimensia preserved in the ecclesiastical centers of the regions (e.g., Arad, Cluj, Sibiu, Timi\u0219oara). Although most of them are copies that have Wallachian origins &ndash; such as the antimension of Metropolitan Barlaam of Wallachia (1672&ndash;9) preserved in the collection of the Archbishopric of Sibiu, or the antimension of Metropolitan Theodosie (1668&ndash;72; 1697&ndash;1708) &ndash; there are also copies of local origin. Of particular importance is the antimension that belonged to the wooden church of Poienele Izei (Maramure\u0219), that is currently preserved in the collections of the Archbishopric of Cluj. Dated 1632, it was discovered in the altar&rsquo;s table between 1962 and 1964 during a restoration process, along with the foundation document (<em>hrisov</em>). Central to the iconography of the antimension is Christ&rsquo;s standing tall in his grave, having blood springing from his rib into a chalice. Behind him there is the cross, with the abbreviation I N \u0426 I at the top, and below the monogram IC XC NI KA. On Christ&rsquo;s left and right sides there are two angels holding two of the instruments of torture: the spear and the sponge on the reed. On each corner of the antimension there are the busts of the four evangelists in round medallions. The entire antimension has a simple border. The signature belongs to Bishop Jeremiah Tissarowsky and accompanies the following inscription: &ldquo;By the grace of the holy and life-giving Spirit and by the holy service of the most holy Jeremia Tissarowsky, by the grace of God, bishop of Galitia, Lyov and Kamenitza-Podolsk, exarch of the Patriarchate of Constantinople of the Holy Orthodox Church, catholic and apostolic [...] [this is an altar] of the all merciful our God and Saviour Jesus Christ, [in order to] celebrate upon it the holy Liturgy. Year 7140 [1632], month of March, day [...].&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nWhen discussing the origins and development of antimensia, besides the actual physical copies, scholars have explored a wide variety of sources. But this plethora of sources does not allow, as in many cases, clear-cut answers. There are still a lot of different scholarly hypotheses and suggestions, and no unanimity has been achieved so far concerning the historical development, usage, or etymology of antimensia. During Byzantine times, theologians such as Germanos of Constantinople, Pseudo-Sophronius of Jerusalem, Nicholas Kabasilas, and Symeon of Thessalonica, produced a series of commentaries to the Liturgy that discussed the antimensia in the framework of the Liturgy, providing information about their liturgical usage, theological symbolism, and consecration. Byzantine <em>euchologia</em> preserved in manuscript collections (e.g., Barberini gr. 336 [mid-8th c.], Sinaiticus gr. 1006 [15th c.], Sinaiticus gr. 974 [1510] or Barberini gr. 390 [c. 1575&ndash;80]) are of paramount importance too for the study of the antimension and its history. To these sources one can add the treatises about the Byzantine ceremonial by Constantine VII (r. 913&ndash;59) or Pseudo-Kodinos (mid-14th c.), the canonical prescriptions formulated by the synods or Church authorities, and other sources, such as chronicles, hagiography, epistles or the <em>Rudder</em> (&Pi;&eta;&delta;\u03ac&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&nu;, Pedalion) published by Agapios the Hieromonk and Nikodemos Hagiorites in Leipzig in 1800. Finally, more aspects concerning its importance can be extracted from editions of liturgical books that were printed and circulated in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, such as <em>Leitourgikons</em>, <em>Euchologia</em>, the ritual for the consecration of churches, or<em> Archieratikons</em>, to name but a few.<br />\r\nConcerning its history, the first textual attestation of the antimension dates to around 700, and it is included in a panegyric dedicated to Marcianus of Syracuse. Nevertheless, several scholars have argued that the origins of the antimensia lay in the movable altars used during the first Christian centuries. This hypothesis has led scholars to believe that the antimension began to be used sometime between the Synod of Trullo of 692 and the Seventh Ecumenical Synod of 787. Other scholars believe that the usage of antimensia originates in Syria during the 6th century, when, because of the persecutions, Monophysite Christians were forced to use movable altars. Another hypothesis was that the antimension dates to the 5th century, as some Eastern Christian Churches broke from the Byzantine Church, and scholars used as proof the many liturgical objects similar to the antimension used in other Eastern Christian traditions: the Siro-Jacobites used the <em>tablitho</em>, a wooden altar in miniature, the Copts use two plates, one of stone and one of wood (<em>maqta</em>&rsquo;), while in Ethiopia the <em>tabot</em> represents the movable altar. But other scholars believed that the origin of the antimension relates to the Iconoclast period of Byzantium, especially the period between 813 and 843 when the Orthodox avoided the iconoclast churches and celebrated the Liturgy in private houses on movable altars. There are some sources that indicate the increasing usage of the antimension in Byzantium, such as the <em>Chronographia </em>of Theophanes the Confessor (758&ndash;817), which mentions that in 776 the Patriarch Niketas I (765&ndash;80) brought an antimension to the Hippodrome for the coronation of the Co-Emperor Constantine VI (r. 780&ndash;97). But many Byzantine sources show that the usage of antimensia was not mandatory. According to the testimonies of Patriarch Manuel II of Constantinople (1244&ndash;55), the Canonist Matthew Blastares (1290&ndash;1360), or the Patriarch Nil Kerameus (1380&ndash;8), the antimension was used for the altars that were not yet consecrated by the bishops. Some Byzantine theologians, such as Patriarch Matthew I (1397&ndash;1410) or Symeon of Thessalonica (c. 1381&ndash;1429), considered sacrilege the placement of antimensia on the unmovable altars. However, it was a Synod of Moscow in 1675 that decided upon the placement of the antimensia on all altars.<br />\r\nThe connection between the relics of martyrs placed in antimensia originates also from the Iconoclastic period. At that time, the practice of placing relics in the altar&rsquo;s tables stopped, especially in the aftermath of the Synod of Hiereia (754), but it was subsequently restored at the Seventh Ecumenical Synod according to Canon 7. As such, in his interpretation, the renowned Canonist Theodore Balsamon (d. 1199) argued that since the antimension can replace the altar&rsquo;s table, it too must contain holy relics. But the entire issue fueled another debate as some scholars argued that there were no relics in the antimensia before the 13th century because the <em>Euchologia</em> bear no mention of this practice. Others interpreted the incorporation of relics into the antimensia as a reaction against Iconoclasm. If the Slavic tradition was clearer regarding the inclusion of relics into antimensia, all of them containing relics, in the Greek tradition there were both antimensia with and without relics sewn in the textiles, which raised in its turn the question of validity for the pieces without relics. Scholars answered the question showing that the presence of relics in the antimension is not mandatory for its validity, since its sacredness is not imparted by the relics but by the anointing with the Holy and Great Myrrh, which consecrates the antimension.<br />\r\nThe antimension&rsquo;s etymology fueled debate among scholars too. They argued that, besides the combination between the Greek and Latin words &ldquo;<em>anti</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>mensa</em>&rdquo;, the following formula might explain the name as well: <em>antiminsion </em>(\u1f00&nu;&tau;&iota;&mu;\u1f77&nu;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&nu;) constructed from the Greek words <em>anti-</em> (\u1f00&nu;&tau;\u1f77; &ldquo;instead of&rdquo;) and <em>minsos</em> (&mu;\u1f77&nu;&sigma;&omicron;&sigmaf;; &ldquo;plate,&rdquo; &ldquo;vessel&rdquo;). Although the first variant was easily accepted, as most scholars did not find anything unusual in the combination between the Greek preposition anti- and the Latin word mensa for this relatively new liturgical object. It has been shown that the second variant, antiminsion, was in fact used in most Late Antique and Byzantine sources. Moreover, the version adopted in Western languages originates in <em>antimensium </em>used in the Catholic Church, while the Slavonic milieu embraced the form <em>antimins </em>(Sl. \u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0441), and Arab Christianity uses the form <em>and\u012bm\u012bs\u012b</em>.<br />\r\nAnother issue that sparked debate among scholars is the connection between the antimension and other liturgical objects, such as the altar&rsquo;s table, the <em>eileton</em>, the aer (\u1f41 \u1f00\u1f75&rho;; Sl. \u0431\u043e\u0437\u0434&yacute;\u0445\u044a, <em>vozd&uacute;kh</em>), and the epitaphios (\u1f41 \u1f10&pi;&iota;&tau;\u1f71&phi;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;; Sl. \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0449\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430, <em>plashchanitsa</em>; &ldquo;placed upon the tomb&rdquo;). The altar&rsquo;s table is covered itself with a white cloth (<em>to katasarkion</em>, &tau;\u1f78 &kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&sigma;\u1f71&rho;&kappa;&iota;&omicron;&nu;) tightly closed on the bottom by a string, symbolizing Christ&rsquo;s shrouds, while on each corner of the table there are placed the busts of the four evangelists. The altar table also hosts pieces of martyr&rsquo;s relics. According to the testimony of Isidoros Pleusiotes (d. 436), the <em>eileton</em> became a mandatory liturgical object during the 5th century. The antimension developed later than the other liturgical objects, but it was not immediately mandatory for celebrating the Liturgy. Only later did it take over and adopted the liturgical function of the <em>eileton</em>. Concerning the aer (i.e., a liturgical object used to cover the Holy Gifts during the Prothesis or Proskomedia and after the Great Entrance at the Liturgy), this was made also of linen on silk and had embroideries with scenes similar to those on the antimension or epitaphios (e.g., <em>Lament of Christ upon the Tomb</em>). Of large dimensions, the epitaphios dates to 14th century Byzantium and it is used during the processions of the Vesper and Matins of the Great Saturday. As with all the other liturgical objects discussed here, the epitaphios also has embroidered the scene of the <em>Lament of Christ upon the Tomb</em>. The link between all these liturgical objects is the symbolism connected with Christ&rsquo;s shrouds and burial.<br />\r\nThe study of antimensia is a fruitful research topic that needs more consideration. Although they are liturgical objects, their relevance as sources for reconstructing the history of the Church cannot be neglected. From a history of art perspective, antimensia can be studied regarding the artistic techniques employed in their production or the changes in the meaning and function of their iconographies. Moreover, the rich amount of antimensia preserved in the repositories of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe but also in Western Europe and the Mediterranean lands, will allow scholars to delve into complex debates about the cross-cultural connections and achievements of various Eastern Christian religious groups between East and West across time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong><br />\r\nMy sentiments of gratitude are directed towards Monk Filotheu B\u0103lan (Petru-Vod\u0103 Monastery), Protos.

The European grant financially supports the Romanian project <em>Early Arabic Printing for the Arab Christians: Cultural Transfers between Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Near-East in the 18th Century (TYPARABIC)</em>, conducted by Ioana Feodorov, PhD, Senior Researcher with the ISEES. The Project is developed by an international team of 12 researchers from Romania and other countries: France, Lebanon, Turkey, Ukraine, and the USA.<br />\r\nThe members of the Project Core Team are researching the context and the outcomes of printing liturgical, patristic, and polemical works in Arabic, in the 18th century, in the Ottoman provinces of the Eastern Mediterranean, for the Christian Arabs who followed the Byzantine rite and for the Catholics. They are achieving an in-depth analysis of the connections between the Romanian Principalities and other East-European states, on one hand, and the Arabic-speaking Christians of the Ottoman Empire, on the other, in the perspective of the social progress brought to the Near East by the printing culture, to which the Romanians essentially contributed. First, the research focuses on the printing-technology transfer from Wallachia and Moldavia to the Eastern lands governed by the Sublime Porte, for the benefit of the Arabic-speaking Christians. Second, a systematic, commented catalog will be prepared for the Arabic books printed between 1701 and 1800 in the Romanian Principalities, in present-day Syria and Lebanon, and the neighboring countries.<br />\r\nOther connected topics of the Project are: the context of the foundation and functioning of the Arabic-type presses in the territories under the Ottoman rule or suzerainty; connections between the faithful of the Byzantine-rite Church of Antioch with Moldavia and Wallachia through travelers and the circulation of the early Greek printed books and manuscripts; the function of printing in preserving the Christian tradition and the penetration of Arabic in the church services, a process contemporary with the penetration of Romanian in the church books of the Romanian lands; contribution of the foundation of the first Aleppo and Beirut presses to the rise of the Renaissance movement of the Christian Arabic culture towards 1820.<br />\r\nThe host institution, the Institute for South-East European Studies of the Romanian Academy, is dedicated to multidisciplinary research areas, focusing on the study of South-Eastern Europe and the Ottoman East: history, society, languages, literatures, minorities, arts, the religious and confessional landscape.<br />\r\nThe Institute for South-East European Studies has developed for more than a decade and a half, under the supervision of dr. habil.

    "text":"<p><em>By&nbsp;Viktor Filas |&nbsp;Khortytsia National Academy, Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description </strong><br />\r\nThe Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi (Akkerman) Fortress now in Ukraine, which is in a relatively good state of preservation, is a unique monument of late medieval military engineering. It was built in the 13th century on the rocky shore of the Dnister Estuary. The establishment of the fortress is rooted in both foreign policy and military contexts. It emerged as a crucial outpost for the principality of Moldavia in the Danube-Dnister interfluve during the 15th and 16th centuries. Equally significant was the construction of a stone fortress to protect the nearby port on Cape Akkerman, which had played a vital role since the time of the Genoese presence in the Black Sea region (mid-13th century to the 15th century).<br />\r\nThe remarkable importance of Bilhorod Fortress in the history of fortification architecture is due to its foundation on the ideas and practices of two main architectural styles: Moldavian and Ottoman. The Moldavian tradition prominently features Transylvanian-Gothic elements, while the Ottoman tradition incorporates Byzantine fortification elements. The presence of the first one can be explained by the consolidation of Moldavian power over the city in the 15th century, while the second one by the construction initiatives of Sultan Bayezid II (r. 1447&ndash;1512) after his capture of the city. It is likely that Byzantine engineers participated in the design of the fortress. Although the Ottomans actively invited European engineers to build and rebuilt fortresses in the empire, their direct impact on Bilhorod Fortress has not been confirmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nBilhorod Fortress derives its layout from Byzantine models. The layout of the fortress, in the form of a regular isosceles triangle, resembles the plan of the Byzantine Capital, Constantinople. Indeed, the fortress plan clearly reveals a compositional core in the form of a regular isosceles triangle (&ldquo;Constantinopolitan type&rdquo;), with the defensive wall of the southern front of the Civil Court serving as its base and the citadel as its apex.<br />\r\nThe initial construction likely dates to the reign of the Moldavian prince Alexander the Good (r. 1400&ndash;32). The most plausible reasons for founding the fortress include the need to counter the increasing Ottoman military threat in the region, the threat of a Lithuanian invasion in the vulnerable lower reaches of the Dniester River, and a desire to strengthen the authority of the Moldavian ruler. During the early decades of the fifteenth century, the citadel &ndash; the earliest element in the current system of fortifications &ndash; was most likely built. Architectural and structural features suggest that the project was executed urgently at the behest of its patron. In 1440, a dividing wall was constructed based on previous fortifications that protected the castle from the south, marking the completion of the fortress. This occurred with support from the Moldavian ruler Stephen II (r. 1410&ndash;47).<br />\r\nAfter successfully withstanding the siege of the Ottoman army in 1454, the Moldavian authorities initiated the largest-scale construction project in the history of Bilhorod Fortress. This comprehensive redevelopment resulted in the formation of the Civil Courtyard Square. The entire defense complex was surrounded by a deep defensive ditch, and the fortress&rsquo;s defenses were bolstered with new towers and walls. It is likely that during this period, a chapel and burial ground were established in the northern part of the Civil Courtyard Square. This Christian religious building likely served as the center of residential development, located on the highest point of the Civil Courtyard area. These construction works began shortly after 1455 and were completed by the end of the decade.<br />\r\nOn the initiative of the Moldavian ruler Stephen III the Great (r. 1457&ndash;1504), the main gate tower (Tower No. 6) was reinforced in 1476. During his reign, the second tier of the old gate tower was rebuilt, and powerful side walls were added to its sides and facade. This modernization occurred in the context of the increased Ottoman expansion toward the southern borders of the Moldavian principality in an effort to control the region.<br />\r\nIn 1484, Ottoman troops conquered Bilhorod Fortress. Following the capture, the Ottoman authorities undertook extensive modernization efforts. Five new towers were erected, along with polygonal towers along the outer perimeter of the Civic Courtyard Square. On the site of the destroyed church in this area of the fortification, the square-plan mosque of Bayezid II was erected. In the southeastern and southwestern towers of the citadel, the third tier was completely rebuilt to accommodate artillery. The Kiliia Gate was also modernized, with the addition of a third tier above it.<br />\r\nSubsequently, in the period between the 16th and 18th centuries, Bilhorod Fortress underwent numerous renovations and upgrades. However, these changes did not alter the general layout of the defensive complex but only partially affected the external appearance of several structures. This approach is understandable given the broader military-political context. Throughout the 16th century, the Ottoman Empire was gradually advancing into Central Europe, and fortresses located deeper within its territory were not prioritized. The Turkish traveler Evliya &Ccedil;elebi, who visited Bilhorod Fortress in the 1650s and provided a detailed description of the complex and its history, did not mention any significant reconstruction, except for the restoration of the walls immediately after the siege of 1484 and the repeated efforts to clean the moat. According to &Ccedil;elebi, it was the deep ditch, rather than the walls, that rendered the fortress impenetrable.<br />\r\nAccording to the Bucharest Peace Treaty of 1812, the lands of Lower Transnistria, including the fortresses of Akkerman (and others, including Tigina, Kiliya, Khotin, and Izmail), were ceded to the Russian Empire. Russian engineers proposed their own methods for strengthening the fortress, which primarily involved constructing a glacis and a covered path, along with minor additions to the inner base of the walls in the southern and eastern sections of the Civil Courtyard Square. Soon after the Russian empire reached the Danube River, the Bilhorod-Dnister Fortress lost its military and strategic significance, which spared it from complete destruction following the Russian Empire&rsquo;s defeat in the Crimean War and the signing of the Paris Peace Treaty in March 1856.<br />\r\nConducting archaeological research at Bilhorod Fortress is currently an urgent priority. This work could help clarify the date when construction began and determine the sequence of building stages, as well as assess the impact of various architectural centers and traditions on the design of the fortress. Particular emphasis should be placed on examining the potential impact of Western European models, which could provide valuable insights into the region&rsquo;s cultural interactions and negotiations. Additionally, immediate preservation efforts are essential due to the fortress&rsquo;s exposure to natural threats, such as soil creep from the Dnister Estuary, which continues to erode the structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nKrasnozhon, Andrei. <em>Krepost&#39; Belgorod (Akkerman) na Dnestre: istoriya stroitel&#39;stva </em>[Belgorod fortress (Akkerman) on Dnister: history of construction].

    "text":"<p><em>By Viktor Filas | Khortytsia National Academy, Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nKiliia Fortress was located in the Danube River delta, where main trade routes connected Europe to the Black Sea. According to one of the legends, in ancient times, the settlement was initially called Achilleus, and received the name from Alexander the Great himself in honor of the hero of ancient Greek mythology, buried nearby, on Snake Island. Kiliia was first mentioned in the 11th century in a list of Byzantine castles during the time of Emperor Andronikos II (r. 1282&ndash;1328), and was incorporated into the military-administrative system of Byzantium. By 1318&ndash;23, the castle was referred to as &ldquo;Kelliia&rdquo; or &ldquo;Likostomion&quot; in the list of Constantinople&rsquo;s possessions.<br />\r\nStrategically located on an island along the northern branch of the Danube River, Kiliia Fortress became a vital transit point and supply base for commercial and military vessels. The city&rsquo;s heyday came under Genoese rule around the middle of the 14th century. This prosperity is evidenced by the notarial acts of the Italian notary Antonio de Podenzolo from 1360&ndash;61. These documents reveal that Kiliia had a central square, the Orthodox Church of St. John, three banks, a loggia of the Genoese commune, residential buildings, shops, a mill, and a port with numerous canals for loading ships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe convenient location of Kiliia Fortress made it a crucial military outpost and trade center, significantly impacting the economic and political life of the Danube region. As such, possession of Kiliia was of strategic importance. Along with Belgorod, Kiliia was considered a key to the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, as well as Hungary. Consequently, military conflicts over Kiliia were frequent, and often intense.<br />\r\nDuring the early 15th century, Kiliia Fortress was part of Wallachia while Mircea the Old (1355&ndash;1418) was on the throne. It later came under the control of the Moldavian ruler Alexander the Good (r. 1400&ndash;32), and this lasted until the dynastic wars between his sons, Stephen II and Elias. These conflicts resulted in Moldavia losing Kiliia Fortress to Wallachia.<br />\r\nThe history of &quot;new&quot; Kiliia began under the reign of the Moldavian prince Stephen the Great (r. 1457&ndash;1504). He attempted to reclaim &quot;old&quot; Kiliia in 1462 but was unsuccessful. It was only in 1465 that the Moldavian army managed to recapture it from the Wallachians. However, due to other territorial losses, Kiliia, as the southern outpost of the Moldavian principality, became isolated from the rest of the country. Consequently, in 1479, Stephen the Great ordered the construction of a new fortress on the northern bank of the Danube River, opposite &ldquo;old&rdquo; Kiliia, which was located on the southern bank. The Chronicle mentions that the fortress was built in record time, from June 22 to July 15, using the labor of &quot;800 masons and 16,000 auxiliary workers.&quot; But could such a large structure really have been built in just 25 days? It is more likely that the chronicle describes the completion of a specific defensive unit of the complex, with the main construction work likely completed earlier.<br />\r\nKiliia Fortress did not remain in Moldavian control for long. In 1484, it was captured by the Ottoman troops of Sultan Bayezid II (r. 1447&ndash;1512). After the conquest, &ldquo;new&rdquo; Kiliia fortress was restored and partially rebuilt. In 1495, 90 Ottoman ships loaded with construction materials arrived in Kiliia. On the site of the church of St. John, located within the fortress, Sultan Bayezid II built a mosque, marking the beginning of Ottoman rule in the Lower Danube region.<br />\r\nBut what did this new Ottoman stronghold on the Danube look like? Both written records and images of the fortress provide insights. Impressed by the new Turkish stronghold, the Ottoman chronicler and official Tursun Bey wrote in his &ldquo;Turkish Chronicles&rdquo;: &ldquo;...The depth of its ditch amazed the imagination, and when water was released into the Danube, the fortress looked like an island. The walls and towers were high and formed barriers, and the enemy&rsquo;s rise to them was impossible.&rdquo; A century and a half later, the Italian traveler Nicolo Barsi also admired the powerful walls and high towers of Kiliia Fortress. In 1659, Bishop Philip Stanislavov described Kiliia as a city with 1,205 houses. The most detailed account came from the explorer Evliya &Ccedil;elebi, who visited in 1659. He described three rows of stone walls and a very deep ditch, provided names for the towers, and offered an internal description of the fortress&rsquo;s structure. Kiliia had several active mosques and two Orthodox churches. In the suburb, there were trading shops, a school, and Turkish baths along the banks of the Danube River.<br />\r\nIn addition to the memoirs of the various travelers who visited Kiliia and left scant records, there are also visual materials that provide clearer insights into the features of the fortifications in Kiliia. The Turkish chronicler Nasuh Matrakci left one of the earliest drawings of the stone fortress, depicting 11 towers, some of which are decorated with circular belts. The fortress had firing loops and ports for artillery. The architecture of the buildings inside the fortress is depicted in a rather monotonous manner, with low houses featuring small windows and tiled roofs, which could potentially serve as defensive strongholds if captured.<br />\r\nOne of the engravings from the diary of the Austrian merchant N. Kleemann, published in 1773, depicts Kiliia Fortress. Kleemann captured the city and fortress on the way to Crimea, where he carried out trade orders for his government. The engraving of the fortress shows urban development characterized by one- and two-story houses, dominated by mosque minarets, giving Kiliia the appearance of an Eastern city. On the right, the engraving shows the fortress itself from the Danube side. Created by the engraver Berndt based on Kleemann&#39;s memories, the image of Kiliia reflects European practices and experience. The engraving features a conventional representation of the landscape and lacks detail, offering only a conditional topography of the city. The city&#39;s Ottoman identity is conveyed by the numerous minarets with crescents on their spires, reflecting the emotional impact of transforming oral information into graphic form. This image of Kiliia Fortress, based on Kleemann&#39;s memoirs, became popular in the last third of the 18th century and was frequently copied and reproduced in various European publications.<br />\r\nOf great interest in the study of the fortress is the prospectus of 1770 from the Military Historical Archive in Moscow. It represents the fortress from a bird&#39;s eye view from the land side, with the Danube River in the background. It makes it possible to imagine the urban space of the Kiliia Forstadt and the fortress as a complex. Another view of the city of Kiliia in 1770 offers an architectural plan of the fortress from three sides, taking into account the landscape.<br />\r\nAs a result of the Russian-Turkish wars, the fortress of Kiliia was captured in 1790 and ultimately became part of the Russian Empire in 1812, attracting new visitors and travelers. Interesting information about Kiliia Fortress is provided by seven watercolors and drawings by the artist Mikhail Ivanov, who was seconded as a draftsman to Governor General G.A. Potemkin. These works, stored in two albums in the State Russian Museum of St. Petersburg, offer valuable insights into the features of the fortress&#39;s during the 19th century.<br />\r\nAt that time, the tallest were the citadel&#39;s towers, which suggests that it was built in an era before the widespread use of firearms. It is most likely that the citadel was built by the Genoese in the 14th century as the residence of a consul or as a military stronghold to protect a trading post from enemy attacks. It can also be seen that one cylindrical tower on the border of the &ldquo;garrison&rdquo; and &ldquo;civilian&rdquo; courtyards has two stone supports on the shore side. The citadel gate is completed with a semicircular arch. The corner north tower is widened toward the base for stability. All curtains are completed with crennel, and the towers are covered with hipped or conical roofs, which is typical for many fortresses in Bessarabia.<br />\r\nThe conquest of Kiliia Fortress by Russian troops led to its modernization. Engineer Kauffer&#39;s drawing is particularly valuable as it overlays the new Turkish bastion fortress onto the old Moldavian one. After reconstruction began in 1794, only five stone towers, an internal moat, and a rebuilt Genoese citadel remained from the original Moldavian-Ottoman fortress. The bastion structure built by Kauffer stood for more than six decades until it was demolished in 1856 in accordance with the Paris Peace Treaty between the Russian and Ottoman empires.<br />\r\nKiliia Fortress, which changed hands over the centuries, played a central role in defending the southern borders of the Moldavian principality and, later, the Ottoman Empire. Located on the northern bank of the Danube River, Kiliia, together with the fortresses at Izmail, Bendery, and Bilhorod, formed a powerful defensive line controlling the crucial steppe corridor between the Black Sea and the Carpathian Mountains. Unlike the other fortresses, however, Kiliia also served as a vital trade hub, giving the Moldavians and later the Ottomans control over shipping along the Lower Danube River.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nByrnya, Pavel. &quot;Kiliya i Nizhnii Dunai v epokhu Stefana Velikogo&quot; [Kiliia and the Lower Danube in the era of Stephen the Great]. <em>Stratum plus</em>&nbsp;6 (2003): 180&ndash;189.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">The work summarizes diverse information about the most important Lower Danube region in the history of medieval Moldavia during the era of Stephen the Great, centered in the city of Kiliia.

    "text":"<p><em>By Ana Marija Grbanovic | Centre for Heritage Conservation Studies and Technologies (KDWT), University of Bamberg</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Colored Mosque (also known as the Decorated Mosque, Painted Mosque, &Scaron;arena \u01c6amija, Xhamia e Larme, Alaca cami, Pasha&rsquo;s Mosque) is located in the heart of the old city center of Tetovo/a, on the southern bank of Pena River in the Republic of North Macedonia. In addition to the mosque, the <em>k&uuml;llye</em> (building ensemble) consists of the ablution fountain, the mausoleum, and income-producing dependencies. The mosque formed through several construction and decoration phases (1438/1495?; 1785; 1833&ndash;34). With its interior dome and painted decorative program, the mosque stands out as one of the most splendid Ottoman Baroque mosques of South-Eastern Europe (1740s-early 19th century, period of&nbsp;European Baroque impact on Ottoman architecture and art). The latest conservation undertakings on the ensemble were completed in the period between 2010 and 2011.<br />\r\nThe first mosque was allegedly built by two female patrons in 1438 following Tetovo/a&rsquo;s conquest by the Ottoman armies in 1382&ndash;92. Following further construction activities around 1495, the original&nbsp;monument was subsequently demolished, rebuilt, and redecorated in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, under the sponsorship of the Sultan&#39;s governor of Tetovo/a, Abdurrahman Pasha. This current mosque was completed in 1833&ndash;34 (1249 AH), according to its marble chronogram (dedicatory text). The mosque&rsquo;s main prayer hall (10.20 x 10.05 m) is preceded by a two-story portico on its north-western side, which forms the interior <em>mahfil </em>(raised platform providing prayer space) for female devotees and theological teaching. The mosque&rsquo;s minaret is adjacent to its south-western wall and it is not integrated into the structure; this may&nbsp;reflect the minaret&#39;s earlier date. The mosque&rsquo;s <em>minbar</em> and <em>mihrab </em>are made out of carved marble, featuring forms characteristic of Ottoman Baroque art and architecture.<br />\r\nThe mosque&rsquo;s exterior and interior wall paintings have been attributed to master painters of Debar, but this hypothesis requires further evidence to be fully established. They feature imitations of architectural decorations, vegetal and geometric motifs, and landscapes, some of which are identifiable. The mosque enclosure comprises the mausoleum (<em>t&uuml;rbe</em>) <i><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">&ndash;</span></span></span></i> an irregular octagonal open structure housing the remains of the initial patrons: the&nbsp;sisters Hur\u015fide (d. 1524) and Mensure Khatun;&nbsp;and an ablution fountain (\u015fadirvan). Income-producing dependencies, such as the nearby hammam, were built in the mosque&#39;s vicinity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe Colored Mosque of Tetovo/a is a monument of outstanding significance for the understanding of Ottoman Baroque architecture in the Balkans, in part due to its monumental and distinctive wall painting program. This painting repertoire is outstanding because of its extensive covering of most of the mosque&rsquo;s interior and exterior surfaces and because of its specifically advanced painting quality,&nbsp;compared to related monuments in the Balkans and in Anatolia.<br />\r\nThe wall painting program was produced in tempera technique (painting on dry support) using roughly 30,000 egg yolks as&nbsp;binders. However, there is no published data concerning archaeometric analyses of&nbsp;these wall paintings, which could reveal the used binders and pigments, and shed light on the artistic technique for the wall paintings. Nevertheless, this mosque is of special&nbsp;importance for our understanding of Islamic and Ottoman architecture due to its wall painting decorative program. This decoration offers&nbsp;links between Ottoman Baroque wall painting in Istanbul and Anatolia (especially in secular structures) and adaptations of this painting style in the Balkans, for mansions and religious buildings, thus pointing to the transfer of ideas, artistic technologies, and visual expressions between Anatolia and the Balkan Peninsula.<br />\r\nThe exterior of the mosque&#39;s portal showcases Baroque elements of acanthus derived vegetal compositions, marble imitations and vases. The floor of the portal features similar decorations, which frame calligraphic inscription panels with hadiths, and the marble historic inscription and chronogram.The decorative program of the mosque&#39;s&nbsp;portal does not match the craftsmanship of the other exterior surfaces and interior of the prayer hall, thus indicating that this part of the mosque was painted by a different group of painters or perhaps apprentices of the master painter who executed&nbsp;the mosque&#39;s interior murals. The exterior surfaces of Tetovo/a&rsquo;s mosque supporting walls are divided into four tiers by painted columns. Diverse patterns are employed to mimic the painted marble plaques filling the spaces between these painted columns. Baroque window openings are visually framed by columns and topped by painted imitations of acanthus-derived compositions. Comparable wall paintings emulating polychrome marble architectural decorations are frequently found&nbsp;in Baroque mosques in the capital of the Ottoman Empire. This tradition, however, stems from the Byzantine architectural tradition and it is also encountered in the Byzantine monuments of South-Eastern Europe.<br />\r\nThe architectural lines of the prayer hall&rsquo;s interior are emphasized with wall paintings featuring Baroque architectural elements and geometrical bands. The wall surfaces are divided into two registers, which are topped by the large interior wooden dome. The walls feature additional cartouches with Hadith inscriptions. The<em> qibla </em>wall (the wall of the mosque oriented towards Mecca, indicating the direction of prayer) features an exceptional depiction of Mecca, which also comprises gilding (possibly a later addition). The three balconies forming the mosque&rsquo;s <em>mahfil</em>, are masterly painted with compositions of vegetal elements featuring trompe l&rsquo;oeil elements characteristic of Baroque painting. The upper row of windows is worth pointing out; they are some of the few window openings featuring Baroque forms, despite their recent restoration. The top areas of the supporting walls forming the prayer hall are framed by a painted cornice featuring landscapes, connected to Istanbul. The area of the dome is divided into registers with architectural elements displaying medallions with vegetal bouquets and landscape scenes, further culminating in bands of geometrical ornamentation and a monumental acanthus-derived rosette.<br />\r\nThe closest parallel to the wall paintings of the Colored Mosque&nbsp;of Tetovo/a is found in the nearby Bektashi tekiyya of Arabati Baba, also in Tetovo/a. In fact, the patron of the mosque also sponsored works at the <em>tekiyya</em> (gathering place of the Sufi brotherhood) and the now ruined castle of Tetovo/a. Depictions of marble imitations and the vegetal elements still preserved at the <em>tekiyya</em> can&nbsp;be directly connected to the Colored Mosque. Furthermore, the signature of the master painter and the date of production of the wall paintings at the <em>tekiyya</em> &ldquo;Usta (master) Zerze Haki 1813&rdquo; provide the name of the master painter of the Colored Mosque. Although the decorative program of the Colored Mosque of Tetovo/a is comparable to the one at the Et&rsquo;hem Bay Mosque in Tirana (1791/1794?; 1819/1821), the two monuments are unlikely to have been painted by the same painters&rsquo; workshop due to differences in the painting styles and iconography of these two monuments.<br />\r\nThe wall paintings of the Colored Mosque of Tetovo/a and related monuments are characterized by elements of Western Baroque painting combined with religious and architectural landscapes, as well as vegetal and geometric compositions. These wall paintings feature linear perspective, three-dimensional features,&nbsp;and use shadow and light to model forms. This wall painting style and especially its themes were&nbsp;popular for the decoration of Ottoman houses and mansions in Western Anatolia, with some of the earliest dated examples and masterly painted landscapes still preserved in the Topkap\u0131 palace in Istanbul.<br />\r\nIn contrast to the Anatolian context, in South-Eastern Europe, architectural and religious landscapes were popular in&nbsp;mosque wall paintings. Moreover, exterior architectural surfaces were also painted in order to monumentalize buildings that were relatively modest in size.&nbsp;These exterior wall surfaces are some of the distinctive features of the Colored Mosque at Tetovo/a. Although we know little of this tradition of exterior decoration, further research could help shed light on these monuments and&nbsp;enable our understanding of the differences between Anatolian and Balkan painted monuments of the Ottoman Baroque period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\nPavlov, Zoran.&nbsp;<em>The Most Significant Values of the Cultural and Natural Heritage: Painted Mosque &ndash; Tetovo</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Ana Marija Grbanovic | Centre for Heritage Conservation Studies and Technologies (KDWT), University of Bamberg</em><br />\r\n<strong>Overview</strong><br />\r\nBosnia-Herzegovina owes its architectural heritage, which formed during more than four centuries of Ottoman rule (1463&ndash;1878), to several distinguishable factors: its specific geographical location, the legacy of the Byzantine architecture, particular skills of the local builders and artisans, and the pre-existing artistic and architectural heritage in the area. Mosques are arguably the most representative type of Ottoman architectural heritage; they are the most widespread and the most documented structures, and they present the focus of Muslim communities&rsquo; religious, social, educational, and political activities. Moreover, they functioned as landmarks of Ottoman sovereignty in the region. Mosques also served as the means for organized urbanization in direct connection to the Islamization process of the Ottoman Empire&rsquo;s newly dominated areas.<br />\r\nThe Balkan Peninsula was conquered by the Ottomans in two main waves: the first one between 1352 and 1402 and the second one between 1415 and 1467. The Bosnian campaign, undertaken by the sultan Mehmed II (r. 1444&ndash;46, 1451&ndash;81) in 1463, is a key moment in history, which brought about the definitive Ottoman conquest of the majority of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the time of its conquest, Bosnia-Herzegovina was divided into two parts; Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Ottomans maintained the same territorial division. The area of the modern Bosnia-Herzegovina was initially part of the Ottoman Rumelia province and it was divided between three <em>sancaks </em>(Ottoman administrative units): the Sancak of Bosnia (Bosna), the Sancak of Herzegovina (Hersek) and the Sancak of Zvornik (Izvornik). Around 1525, the Ottomans created Elayet of Bosnia (<em>beylerbeylik</em>; large administrative entity), which was subdivided into the Sancak of Bosnia, the Sancak of Herzegovina, the Sancak of Vi\u010ditrina, the Sancak of Prizren, the Sancak of Klis, the Sancak of Krka, and the Sancak of Pakrac. The borders of the <em>sancaks </em>and of the <em>eyalet</em> continued to change through time. Bosnian territory firstly bordered the Hungarian kingdom and the Venetian Republic and later the Hapsburg Empire, the Venetian Republic and the Dubrovnik Republic (Ragusa). It accordingly played an important role as the furthest oriental outpost in Europe, an important military area and a landmark of the Ottoman territory.<br />\r\nWith the arrival of the Ottomans in the Balkans, the process of Islamization started. Bosnia-Herzegovina seems to be a particular case because of the considerably high percentage of converts, in comparison to the other areas of the Ottoman Balkans. In Bosnia-Herzegovina in just nine decades after the Ottoman conquest, roughly speaking, approximately 46% of the population was listed as Muslims. Following the conquest, there was a need to stabilize the Ottoman sovereignty in the Balkans, not only through the administration system, but also by visual means. This was performed through urbanization, which was closely linked to the process of Islamization of the new territories. New types of buildings appeared in this geographical area in response to the arrival of Islam, which strongly impacted the public and private lives of worshippers.<br />\r\nThe 16th century is the moment when the Ottoman architecture reached its peak under the rule of the sultan Sulayman the Magnificent. Above all, during his rule, in the Empire&#39;s capital, Istanbul (and later in the city of Edirne), Sinan&rsquo;s indisputably creative and unmatchable architectural masterpieces were constructed. Because of the stability of the Empire and general welfare during that time, this period corresponds to the peak of architectural production also in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the 17th century, the power, integrity, and stability of the Ottoman Empire were partially halted. Nonetheless, some historic events (for example, the Siege of Vienna in 1683) show that the power of the Empire was not yet in decline. Due to several unsuccessful attempts of expansion of the Empire and uprisings of peasants in the borderlands, the Ottoman architectural production in Bosnia-Herzegovina had partially started to halt.<br />\r\nAccording to the 1933 census, there were 1,120 mosques in Bosnia-Herzegovina, out of these, 70% featured a wooden, rather than a stone minaret. Regional differences can be observed in this respect: in Bosnia region 81% mosques featured a wooden minaret and in Herzegovina region wooden minarets amounted to only 13%. Among these, a total of 36 historical mosques featured monumental architectural form with a stone minaret and prayer hall covered by an external monumental dome. Out of these 36 mosques, 28 mosques were constructed in the 16th century, while others were built between the 17th and the 18th century. The majority of these mosques were badly damaged or entirely destroyed during the Yugoslav dissolution war in Bosnia-Herzegovina (1992&ndash;96) and they were rebuilt afterwards.<br />\r\nMonumental domed mosques can be further divided between mosques with single-space prayer halls and mosques with the main prayer hall consisting of several architectural spaces. Ground plans for these monuments were fully defined in the center of the Ottoman Empire and subsequently transmitted into the south-eastern European space, likely via plans and by mosque construction supervisors sent from the center of the Empire. Minarets of mosques in south-eastern Europe assume considerable heights and feature a masterly level of stonemasonry. It has been proposed that special groups of minaret builders were mobile across the Balkan Peninsula for minaret construction, but this hypothesis would require further evidence. For Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially the Herzegovina region, archives of Dubrovnik hold extensive evidence of Dubrovnik stonemasons being mobilized for church and mosque construction in the Herzegovinian <em>sancak</em>.<br />\r\nThe classical Ottoman architectural activities in Bosnia-Herzegovina lasted between approximately the 1540s until the late 16th century. They were marked by the adoption of the domed single-spaced mosque with an adjacent exterior porch and the minaret as the main type of structure for monumental patronage. One of the best-known monuments of Bosnia-Herzegovina, destroyed in the armed conflict, and recently reconstructed through rebuilding, was the Alaca mosque in Fo\u010da (1550&ndash;51); it featured structure consisting of square prayer hall flanked by entrance portal and minaret, but its unique feature were wall painting decorations on the portal and in the interior of the prayer hall. Perhaps the most monumental of the mosques in Bosnia-Herzegovina is the Ghazi Husrev Bey mosque in Sarajevo (1530&ndash;31). It features a tripartite monumental prayer hall preceded by a monumental portal and flanked by one of the largest minarets. Recent research of the mosque uncovered several layers of wall paintings in its interior spaces. Further significant mosques of the given mosque type comprise: the Karadzozbeg mosque in Mostar (1557&ndash;58), the Ali Pasha mosque in Sarajevo (1560&ndash;61), the Ferhad Pasha mosque in Sarajevo (1561&ndash;62), and the Hajji Ali mosque in Po\u010ditelj (1557&ndash;58). Other domed mosques constructed in Bosnia-Herzegovina, even the ones built later than the 16th century, share similar characteristics and dispositions of the floor plan, but are slightly different in their cross-section plan, execution and lesser harmony of proportions. This may be considered an argument suggesting that Ottoman architects from the center of the Empire were not present at mosque construction sites, but rather, local master builders and master stonemasons built mosques according to plans and instructions as well as existing structural models. Some examples comprise the Balagu&scaron;a mosque in Livno (constructed no later than 1586), the Sultan S&uuml;leyman mosque in Blagaj (1520&ndash;21), the \u010cekrek\u010dija Mosque (1526) and the Ba&scaron;\u010dar&scaron;ijska Mosque (1528) in Sarajevo.<br />\r\nThe period from around the late 16th century until the middle of the 18th century is marked by a considerably less monumental architectural production in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, it has been shown that some larger complexes were still constructed in that period. For example, the Mehmed Pasha Kukavica complex (1751/1752) in Fo\u010da, the Koski Mehmed Pasha mosque (1612&ndash;18) in Mostar, the Tekijska (1579) mosque in Konjic, the Esme Sultanije mosque (1749/1750) in Jajce, the Kur&scaron;umlija mosque (1560, construction date disputed) in Maglaj and the Colored Mosque (present day structure is from 1757) in Travnik. One of the most striking mosques is the Colored (&Scaron;arena) Mosque in Travnik which features a monumental wall painting repertoire comparable to that of the Et&rsquo;hem Bay Mosque in Tirana (construction started in 1793<span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">&ndash;</span></span></span>94 and concluded in 1822<span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif\">&ndash;</span></span></span>23) and the Colored (&Scaron;arena) Mosque (first structure from 1495, present day structure from 1785 and 1833&ndash;34) in Tetovo/a. Further Ottoman structures erected in Bosnia-Herzegovina which display comparable construction technology and are indisputable architectural masterpieces, are the Vi&scaron;egrad Mehmed Pasha Sokolovi\u0107 bridge built between 1571&ndash;77 and designed by Sinan himself, and the Mostar Old Bridge (Stari most) constructed in &ndash;53 (subsequently destroyed and rebuilt).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Key Issues and Debates</strong><br />\r\nOttoman architecture in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the broader Balkans tends to be frequently considered of provincial nature. Accordingly, Ottoman architectural heritage is often misunderstood as simple identity markers not worthy of closer attention and analysis of their artistic and architectural value. Within the Ottoman Empire, Bosnia-Herzegovina was always a borderland; initially, it had an important role as a stronghold for further expansion of the Empire towards the West and in the later period, it assumed its significance as a fortification to defend the imperial territories. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, Eastern and Western cultural and religious influences met the rich local tradition, interacted, coexisted in symbiosis and catalyzed the transformation and development of a complex and multicultural society. Even if this architectural production can be simply labeled as a provincial attempt to imitate the capital&rsquo;s larger and more elaborate prototypes, the so-called creativity of this interpretation should not be devalued. The local society did not only gradually adapt to the new religion, lifestyle and material culture, but above all adapted the new culture to their needs and tastes. The following results from this relationship: differences in style, scale, function, type of patronage and execution of structures.<br />\r\nIn respect to the rest of the Ottoman Balkan lands, Ottoman mosques in Bosnia-Herzegovina were conditioned by the pre-existing architecture, their role as landmarks, regional characteristics and skills of local builders. This group of mosques is rather varied and has diverging characteristics. However, when compared to the rest of the Balkans, extraordinary regionalization of architectural production is the first visible characteristic. Moreover, the local, rather liberal interpretation brought more diversity when compared to the rest of the Balkan mosques. It can also be suggested that in the interpretation and execution of mosques, the domestic component in all three styles of mosques was stronger than the Ottoman component.<br />\r\nRegional differences between mosques, evident mainly in the construction material and building techniques, result in distinct architectural styles and consequently in overall appearance of the mosques. Differences can be observed in monumental domed mosques but they are even more striking and evident on mid-sized and small mosques. One quarter of mosques built in Bosnia-Herzegovina are mosques with a four-sloped roof and a stone minaret, while 70% of all mosques built (before 1933) in Bosnia-Herzegovina are four-sloped mosques with a wooden minaret. The founders of these structures were mainly locals. Therefore, no guidelines or surveillance could have been implied on these endowments from the center of the Empire. These regional differences are the most pronounced in the roof form, application of different kinds of roof coverings and minaret designs. The four-sloped roof mosque with a wooden minaret can be considered as showing the highest level of the creativity, skill and invention of local builders. The major absence of the dome, the presence of the wooden interior dome, the high frequency of wooden minarets and a four-sloped roof are some of the striking outcomes that manifest it.<br />\r\nThe significance of Bosnian Ottoman mosques and their strong symbolic value for the Bosniak community also manifested itself during the dissolution of Yugoslavia. On the basis of ethnic conflicts between Bosnian Croats, Serbs and Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), the Yugoslav dissolution wars manifested themselves as a war on culture. During the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina (1992&ndash;96) Muslim, Christian and Jewish architectural religious heritage played a significant role as markers of religious and ethnic identities, and it was systematically destroyed. This systematic destruction of religious structures can be linked to war crimes and ethnical cleansing. A survey, conducted for the Cultural Heritage Division of the Council of Europe, provides an independent assessment of the state of cultural heritage after the Bosnian War in the year 2002; it reports that a total of 332 Muslim sites, 277 of which were mosques, have been documented in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and out of these 60% of monuments (161 sites) were mosques, out of which 136 mosques were almost entirely destroyed. In the post-war reconciliation process, these mosques &ndash; markers of Muslim presence - assumed further importance. The question of the reconstruction of mosques proved to be a sensitive issue. In the past, locating and constructing a mosque was largely a political act and currently, reconstruction interventions on these monuments, or their denial, are also politically charged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nAndrejevi\u0107, Andrej. <em>Islamska Monumentalna Umetnost XVI Veka u Jugoslaviji.

    "text":"<p><em>By Melpomeni Perdikopoulou | Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Department of History and Archaeology</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nAmong the mosques that were built in Thessaloniki after its conquest by the Ottomans (1430), Alaca Imaret is one of the most representative examples of the z&acirc;viyeli-mosque architectural type, which was popular during the first two centuries of the Ottoman period. The mosque was built in 1485 (889 Hijra) during the month of Muharrem, the first lunar month of the Muslim calendar, according to its dedicatory inscription written in Ottoman script. It was commissioned by Ishak Pasha when he retired from his position as Grand Vezir of Sultan Bayezid II (r. 1481&ndash;1512) and was appointed sanjak-bey (high administrator) of Thessaloniki.<br />\r\nIn its original form, which has been preserved to this day, the Alatza Imaret is a z&acirc;viyeli-mosque (or inverted-T architectural type) with a vaulted portico, two central domed spaces &ndash; that of the &ldquo;enclosed courtyard&rdquo; and the prayer hall &ndash; and four domed eyvans (side accommodation rooms for Suffis and dervishes with fireplaces and cupboards), built in pairs of two on each side. Despite certain structural interventions, Alatza Imaret is considered to have remained typologically unchanged. The Ishak Pasha Imareti was built on an empty, public area. In its initial phase, the monument had a five-part portico, where granite and marble columns alternated, with a single central entrance. The cloisonn&eacute; masonry was visible, its domes were covered with lead sheets, and on the south side stood the minaret decorated with colorful glazed tiles (hence the name &ldquo;Alaca&rdquo;, meaning colorful).<br />\r\nThe floor of the enclosed courtyard was paved with marble, as were the floors in the four ancillary rooms. The enclosed courtyard and the prayer area were decorated with frescoes. North of the mosque there were ovens, probably for the preparation of food. According to the vakifname (founding/dedication document) Ishak Pasha&rsquo;s endowment in Thessaloniki is a khairi vakif, a charitable endowment, which aimed to provide food to the needy (Imaret) and at the same time secured an income for the son of the patron and his most worthy successors, who would take over the management of the endowment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nThe Alaca Imaret (1485) is one of the most notable examples of the z&acirc;viyeli-mosque architectural type among the mosques constructed in Thessaloniki following the Ottoman conquest. The zaviyeli-mosques were popularised during the first two centuries of the Ottoman period and, with several variations, spread throughout the empire. There are four more examples of this type in Greece: the Mehmet Bey Camii in Serres, the Imaret of Evrenos in Komotini, the Iskender Bey Mosque in Giannitsa, and the S&uuml;leymaniye in Rhodes.<br />\r\nIt was built during the era of Sultan Bayezid II (r. 1481&ndash;1512), which is characterized by economic development and the attempt to preserve the acquired territories of previous periods. After the dynastic dispute with his brother Jem, Bayezid ascends the throne, re-establishes the vakifs, and welcomes to Constantinople Sufi orders. The zaviyeli-mosques that were erected by high-ranking officials, like the Alaca Imaret of Thessaloniki, during the era of Bayezid II seem to follow more traditional models, set by previous sultans. This fact underlines the centralism that characterizes the era of Bayezid II, while the preference of the officials for the more conservative version is probably attributed to the impossibility of imitating the standards set by the capital (with the exception of the Mehmet Bey Camii of Serres, which was built by the husband of Bayezid&rsquo;s daughter).<br />\r\nIn Alaca Imaret no innovative element is introduced, which would contribute to the development of the architectural type. Instead, the emphasis appears to be on the social function of the building rather than its religious significance. This is evidenced by the presence of side apartments equipped with fireplaces and cupboards, indicating their role in hospitality rather than purely religious activities. Alaca Imaret thus emerges as a representation of a zaviyeli-mosque situated on the periphery of the empire. There, it seems that the standards set by the sultanate of the time were either met or intentionally overlooked by the patron, who opted for more conventional models.<br />\r\nThe erection of zaviyeli-mosques is connected with the territorial expansion of the Ottoman Empire as the number of mosques increased almost in parallel with the conquests, Mosques were erected in newly conquered areas. This versatile type of building perfectly served the needs of a developing state, being a mosque and at the same time a place for hosting dervishes, who accompanied the Ottoman troops and participated in the battles. Through their teachings, such figures spread Islam to Christian subjects. As such, the zaviyeli-mosques played a pivotal role in the Ottomanization process of cities in the southern Balkan region, like Thessaloniki, Bursa, Edirne, Plovdiv, Serres and Komotini.<br />\r\nAs for the Alaca Imaret, after the establishment of the zaviyeli-mosque, the homonymous district was established around it. Based on population registers, Alaca Imaret functioned as a pole of attraction for Muslim habitants who moved to Thessaloniki. The founder also had the right to bring a population in town. Thus, the Muslim population of Thessaloniki increased, while the Christian population decreased, contributing to the process of its Ottomanization over time.<br />\r\nIn addition to Alaca&rsquo;s place in the development of the zaviyeli-mosque architectural type, and its role in the Ottomanization process of Thessaloniki, the Imaret also had practical and symbolic functions. It relates to the importance of food distribution within Muslim societies. The ability of the Ottomans to supply and distribute food to their subjects in turn fed their own power, constituting a source of legitimacy for the Ottoman regime, especially in the newly conquered areas. Food permeated ritual practices and acquired important symbolic meaning. Yet it was also the necessary basis of human life; everyone needed to eat. As a result, giving food was a consummate act of charity. The Ottomans had the power to feed, and their power was nurtured by feeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading </strong><br />\r\nBoykov, Grigor. &ldquo;&Tau;he T-Shaped Zaviye/\u0130marets of Edirne: A Key Mechanism for Ottoman Urban Morphological Transformation.&rdquo; <em>Journal of the Ottoman and Turkish Studies Association </em>3, no. 1 (2016): 29&ndash;48.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This publication highlights the key role of the T-type zaviye/imarets in the process of structural change of the Ottoman cities in Anatolia and the Balkans in the period between&nbsp;the 14th and the 15th centuries.</p><p>Kuban, Do\u011fan.<em> Ottoman Architecture</em>.

    "text":"<p><em>By Melpomeni Perdikopoulou | Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Department of History and Archaeology</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe Imaret of Komotini is located in the western part of the city of Komotini. It is at a short distance from the eastern walls of the Byzantine castle of Koumoutzines, which was an administrative and military center and station on the main road from Constantinople to the west. The Imaret of Komotini is one of the oldest Ottoman monuments in Thrace and is related to the expansion and dominance of the Ottomans in the region (1360&ndash;80).<br />\r\nBased on recent field research and publications, the Imaret of Komotini has been identified with the Imaret which, according to the sources, was built by the conqueror of the city, Gazi Evrenos, in 1364/65&ndash;1382/83. It is a building with three rooms (eyvans) that form a T-shape (zaviyeli-cami) on the ground plan. The middle space, square in design, is the center of the building. It is covered with a hemispherical dome with a low octagonal drum through four lobes made using the technique of prismatic triangles. It is open on the north side with two wide pilasters supporting a tall semicircular arch. In the middle of its south wall, a rectangular niche is present, which is crowned by a pointed arch. Two stone doorways with large relief arches above lead to the two side rooms, which are similarly covered and equipped with fireplaces. The building is constructed in the Byzantine technique of brick-enclosed masonry.<br />\r\nThe use of carved stones is also evident around the corners of the structure. At the top of the arch of the south side is an inlaid marble female head dating to Roman times. A toothed cornice crowns the masonry. The complex of the Imaret and the adjacent Eski Mosque mark the new phase of Ottomanisation within the city. The new rulers settled outside the walled city, which housed the Christians, shaping the new parameters of the city&rsquo;s development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nThe Imaret of Komotini is one of the oldest Ottoman buildings in the Balkans, perhaps the oldest and architecturally of great importance; the imaret follows an inverted T-plan (of the multifunctional building type or zaviyeli-cami) facilitating social and, to a lesser extent, ritualistic uses. Discussions of the building&rsquo;s plan usually ignore the side rooms, which functioned as guestrooms and kitchens. Rather than being used as a space for prayer, the central hall of the Imaret in Komotini is likely to have been the communal hall of the building &ndash; that is, the rear end of the central hall may not have been the section reserved for praying.<br />\r\nCuriously enough, this part is not oriented to Mecca. The building also lacks the mihrab niche and minaret. It was not built for use as a Friday Mosque, as previous scholarship has suggested. Rather, it is assumed that it was meant to be a building for the public good, a point made especially convincing by Evrenos&rsquo; construction of a mosque now called the &ldquo;Old Mosque&rdquo;, situated less than \ufb01fty meters to the west of the imaret.<br />\r\nWhat is more, the imaret in Komotini probably forms the earliest example of the building types mentioned above, even before three other similar structures in Bithynia were erected. The plan of the Komotini building is comparable to that of the imarets built in Asia Minor: the Yakub &Ccedil;elebi \u0130maret (c. 1389) and Nil&uuml;fer Hatun \u0130maret (c. 1387) in \u0130znik, as well as the mosque/madrasa complex of Murad I in Bursa bearing the same plan. Even more important, is that while the T-type building of Murad I in Bursa claimed sultanic monumentality, the others were designed according to a more multifunctional, and down-to-earth, plan.<br />\r\nSigni\ufb01cant differences in the nature of patronage for the buildings in Bithynia and Thrace are as follows: although the reign of Murad I witnessed a boom in royal T-type building construction, only the mosque/madrasa complex in Bursa was named after him. The structures located in \u0130znik &ndash; the Yakub &Ccedil;elebi \u0130maret and the Nil&uuml;fer Hatun \u0130maret &ndash; were dedicated to the members of the dynastic family. The Komotini imaret was commissioned by a nonroyal patron. Situated away from the capital in the newly conquered Ottoman lands, the imaret in Komotini, along with the han and the mosque, became a visual vehicle to promote Evrenos&rsquo; political agenda against Murad&rsquo;s centralizing policies.<br />\r\nMoreover, the imaret of Hac\u0131 Evrenos served as a pivotal point in proto-Ottoman G&uuml;m&uuml;lcine (Komotini), with its geo-reference enabling the reconstruction of the town&rsquo;s layout, being linked to the extension route connecting Via Egnatia with the main entrance of the Byzantine castle. Positioned facing the public highway (&ccedil;ar\u015f\u0131ya or tariki &lsquo;am) and in close proximity to the Byzantine castle&rsquo;s main gate, the Imaret reflected a typical proto-Ottoman site placement.<br />\r\nThe broader project of Ottomanization in frontier principalities like G&uuml;m&uuml;lcine relied on the activities of the Ahis, who were rewarded by the early sultans with land grants or revenue shares for their services in conquest. These grants facilitated the establishment of zaviyeli-mosques, which played a crucial role in urban stability and development. Through tax exemptions and administrative autonomy, the Ahis contributed to the maintenance and expansion of the urban network, reflecting a dynamic mechanism for governing newly conquered territories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\n&Ccedil;a\u011faptay, Suna. &ldquo;The Road from Bithynia to Thrakia: Gazi Evrenos&rsquo; Imaret in Komotini and Its Architectural Framework.&rdquo;<em> Byzantinische Forschungen</em> 30 (2011): 429&ndash;42.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">The article focuses on the architectural framework of Gazi Evrenos&#39; Imaret in Komotini and delves into the historical and architectural significance of the imaret founded by the notable Ottoman military commander.</p><p>Doukata, Sofia. &ldquo;Imaret.&rdquo; In <em>The Ottoman Architecture of Greece</em>, edited by Ersi Brouskari, 324&ndash;26.

    "text":"<p><em>By Melpomeni Perdikopoulou | Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Department of History and Archaeology</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nAccording to its dedicatory inscription, the Mehmet Bey Camii was built in 1492&ndash;93 by Mehmed Bey (r. 1455&ndash;1506), the son of the Grand Vezir Ahmed Pa\u015fa and spouse of Bayezid II&rsquo;s daughter Sel&ccedil;uk Hatun (1463&ndash;1508), whose monument is located a short distance to the West. It can be classified as &lsquo;zaviyeli cami&rsquo; or a &ldquo;multi-functional or T-shaped&rdquo; mosque. This is an amalgamation type of building that was broadly diffused alongside religious and secular structures during the first two centuries of Ottoman rule.<br />\r\nIt comprises of domed spaces arranged along the longitudinal axis. These are the prayer hall or mihrab compartment and the domed sofa. These two central units are flanked by side rooms &ndash; the tabhanes &ndash; which give access to the domed sofa unit. The mosque consists of a spacious central area covered by a massive dome (14.58 m.). Surrounding this central space from the east and west are four side rooms covered by lower, domed vaults. From the southern wall protrudes a pentagonal apse known as the &ldquo;mihrab.&rdquo; On the northern side, where the main entrance is located, there is a colonnaded open gallery with a five-part upper structure (portico or son cemaat yeri). The central section, above the entrance, is covered by a hemispherical dome, while the side spaces on either side are covered by lower, domed vaults.<br />\r\nThe columns are made of white marble, as are the capitals, which are adorned with intricately crafted stalactite motifs. Above the entrance, there is a dedicatory inscription, in Ottoman script, stating the name of the founder and the year of establishment. The mosque is constructed of yellow sandstone, with meticulous ashlar masonry, except for the vaulted sections, which are built of bricks. Internally, the walls were covered with frescoes, of which a few sections survive today under the dome. Initially, all the vaults of the building were covered with lead. According to traveler descriptions, a magnificent garden surrounded the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance </strong><br />\r\nThe mosque of Mehmed Bey is the only surviving zaviyeli-camii in the city of Serres, and it is typologically related to the repair phase (second phase) of Koca Mustafa Mosque. They both are categorized as multifunctional buildings that are connected with Suffis and dervishes, which dominated the first two centuries of Ottoman rule. Such structures seem to have disappeared by the end of Suleiman I&rsquo;s reign (r. 1520&ndash;66).<br />\r\nAs the Ottoman Beylik evolved from a frontier state to an empire, it became necessary to emphasize orthodox Sunni Islam, advocated by the sultan and the central administration, rather than the heterodoxy of the dervishes and, consequently, the emphasis on the praying area than the space of the closed courtyard and the eyvans. These spaces gradually lost their autonomy and were almost integrated with the space of the closed courtyard and the prayer area. This development culminated in the years of S&uuml;leyman I (r.1520&ndash;66), when the prayer area became particularly large and the eyvans lost their original function. They were mere reminders of places of hospitality and accommodation.<br />\r\nThe domical components of the T-shaped mosques are summarized in two congruent domed spaces arranged along the longitudinal axis. These are the prayer hall or mihrab compartment, the mosque space proper, and the domed sofa. These two central units are flanked by side rooms &ndash; the tabhanes &ndash; which give access to the domed sofa unit. The very definition of the type as multi-functional mosques derives from the existence of these flanking compartments. The fact that these compact volumetric units were directly accessed from outside and were connected with the focal mihrab unit only through the domed sofa shows that they were designed for dwelling purposes. These side wings are small spaces, with no prayer niches. For residential purposes, they were provided with the necessary closets, niches, and fireplaces.<br />\r\nIn some cases, the gallery of the final assembly [son cemaat yeri] was added; this is the portico extending over the facade, which completes the architectural composition of the type. Finally, minarets were the only non-original parts, which most often constituted posterior additions. Although some early examples retain minarets that give out an original impression, a group of significant, early monuments do not bear a minaret. This confirms the theory that initially zaviyeli-mosques (or T-shaped mosques) did not function as communal mosques.<br />\r\nThe Mehmed Bey Mosque constitutes one of the late manifestations of this building type, when such mosques had already lost their multi-functional dimension and were confined to their concrete function as places of gathering and prayer. This occurred through the loss of the domed-sofa section and the emergence of the mihrab unit as its main volumetric and operational component, to which the lateral spaces [tabhanes] still allowed access even after their significant reduction in size. In this case, the side compartments have no fireplaces or cupboards, hence they could not function as accommodation rooms. They simply are a remnant of the architectural type without any confirmed function.<br />\r\nIt would seem that in the Mehmet Bey Camii, the religious function outweighs the social one, and the building operated exclusively as a mosque and not as an accommodation place for travelling dervishes. The typological parallels are the T-shaped mosques of Davud Pa\u015fa (1485) in Istanbul and Piri Pa\u015fa at Silivri (1530). The Mehmet Bey Camii is directly connected with the social status of its founder, who was a Grand Vezir and the husband of an Ottoman princess. Therefore, the building features a progressive layout with the mihrab niche and the integration of the side compartments emulating contemporary examples (i.e. the Alaca Imaret of Thessaloniki).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\nBalta, Evangelia. <em>Les vakifs de Serres et de sa r&eacute;gion XVe- XVIe si&egrave;cles.</em>&nbsp;Athens: Centre de recherches n&eacute;o-hell&eacute;niques, Fondation nationale de la recherche scientifique, 1995.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px;\">This study organizes the existing information on the vakifs of Serres and demonstrates the evolution of the institution during the first two centuries of Ottoman rule.</p><p>Bessi, Ourania. &quot;The Ottoman Town in the Southern Balkans from the 14th to the 16th Centuries: A Morphological Approach.&quot; A thesis submitted to the University of Birmingham for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.

    "text":"<p><em>By Adriana Ga\u0219par | Researcher at &#39;Vasile P&acirc;rvan&#39; Institute of Archaeology, Bucharest, Romania</em><br />\r\n<strong>Description</strong><br />\r\nThe traces of the Ali Bey Mosque are located in the city of Timi\u0219oara in the western part of Romania. It was an important mosque in Timi\u0219oara fortress when it functioned as a province of the Ottoman Empire (1552&ndash;1716). At that time, the fortress represented a unit that was formed according to the topography of the area, composed of the castle or citadel, the fortified town, and two suburbs, called &ldquo;Big Palanka&quot; and &ldquo;Small Palanka&rdquo;. The Ali Bey Mosque was erected in the fortified city, very close to the main mosque called Suleyman Mosque, probably the first one built after 1552 when Timi\u0219oara was transformed into an Ottoman province. Although the documents do not yet provide certainty about the year of construction, it is possible that the Ali Bey Mosque was built and put into use after 1663-64, perhaps as early as 1665 when the vak\u0131f or the charitable institution established by a certain Ali Pasha was functional. It is possible that the mosque was part of the complex of buildings of this institution and was named after its founder, Ali Bey. Until 1664, the mosque did not feature in the descriptions of the Ottoman historian, writer, and traveler Evliya \u04aaelebi who visited Timi\u0219oara for the last time in 1664, nor in the sketches and spy reports of the Austrian Henrich Ottendorf who visited Timi\u0219oara in 1663, when he was part of the Austrian delegation led by Ambassador von Goes to the Pasha of Belgrade.<br />\r\nThe first information about the construction of this mosque dates to around 1699 when the structure was marked on the city plan, drawn up by the architect Radogna Meimer. In the military conflict of 1716, the Habsburg troops defeated the Ottoman army, and the Habsburgs took over the administration of Timi\u0219oara. The plans of Timi\u0219oara fortress, made in 1716, indicate that the Ali Bey Mosque was near the Pasha&#39;s House and it was among the few buildings that survived the previously mentioned siege. With the end of Ottoman rule in the eyalet (administrative division of the Ottoman Empire) and the departure of the Ottoman population from Timi\u0219oara, many of the Muslim places of worship were demolished or repurposed. The building of the Ali Bey Mosque survived. In 1727, it still appears marked on a map from the Austrian period. The building was probably used as a warehouse, like other similar ones in Timi\u0219oara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Significance</strong><br />\r\nDuring the first years of Habsburg rule, the Ottoman fortress of Timi\u0219oara, fortified with palisades and a defensive ditch, was rebuilt from the ground up, according to the plans of a bastion fortification. The massive walls of the new construction would exceed the area occupied by the fortified city, which is why many of the buildings erected during the Ottoman administration were gradually demolished and entire areas were leveled. That is why no building in Timi\u0219oara dating to the 164-years of Ottoman Empire control has survived. Only archaeological investigations covering overlapping areas of the Ottoman city perimeter capture parts or foundations left in the free spaces between the buildings erected after 1716.<br />\r\nThe foundations of Ali Bey Mosque were brought back to light in the archaeological campaign of 2014&ndash;15 when, on the occasion of the modernization works of the &ldquo;Historical Center&rdquo; of the city, several archaeological excavations were carried out. The mosque&#39;s location was known from the overlay of the historical plans over the current ones, later confirmed by the archaeological excavations. Two opposite corners were discovered that closed the plan of a rectangular building, with walls raised from rows of bricks and supported by a complex foundation. From the point of view of the construction technique, a trench was dug, as wide as the foundation of the building. Along its bottom, groups of split oak trunks were beaten to the ground level, over which was placed a reinforcement consisting of beams of wood, fixed with iron nails. To fix the arrangement, a mixture of lime mortar, broken brick and tiles were poured into the trench. The archaeological research only captured the empty spaces of rectangular sections, which remained visible in the mortar, resulting from the rotting of the wooden beams in the reinforcement, but also the iron nails with which they were fixed. Walls were built of brick courses and fixed with mortar and raised over this foundation. The upper part of which was heavily affected by modern works in the area.<br />\r\nAfter the data was gathered, it was revealed that the rectangular plan formed a construction measuring 12.5 x 11.50 m. In the vicinity of its eastern side, a wall 2.70 m long and 0.60 m thick was also discovered, which could have belonged to a room. Regarding the interior elements, the archaeological research has captured part of the brick pavement, but also a mihrab-oriented southeast, an important element in the interior structure of a mosque, indicating the direction to Mecca, the most important pilgrimage center of Muslims. Around Ali Bey Mosque, 55 graves were also discovered, some with gravestones.<br />\r\nThe presence of artifacts in the context of Ali Bey Mosque indicates activity in this area starting from the second half of the 17th century, a fact that confirms the historical information. The evidence revealed a fragment of a Chinese white porcelain mug, stylized on the inside and outside with vegetal and floral decoration - in cobalt blue on a white base, along with a knife handle made of horn, but also three smoking pipes, two of which are made of kaolin paste and one of red clay. The presence of several stove tiles discovered inside the mosque room could indicate the existence of a heating stove.<br />\r\nCurrently, the foundation walls of the Ali Bey Mosque are no longer visible in the open air. After the archaeological research, the entire structure was covered with sand and protected in situ, the outline of the discovered walls was marked on the pavement above with a different color.<br />\r\nThe importance of the discovery of the walls of the Ali Bey Mosque is also of great interest to universal history because it refers to elements that were part of the religious life of one of the most important Ottoman provinces (Timi\u0219oara Eyalet), which for 164 years was in the contact zone with the Christian world.<br />\r\nThe discovery of the Ali Bey mosque brings new perspectives on how religion was practised and reintegrated into the daily life of the community in the fortress of Timi\u0219oara throughout the 17th century. The exceptional archaeological data completes the still unknown historical information and represents a starting point through which we can understand better the role of places of worship in the process of Islamization of a Christian city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further Reading</strong><br />\r\n<em>C\u0103l\u0103tori str\u0103ini despre \u0162\u0103rile Rom&acirc;ne</em>, vol.
